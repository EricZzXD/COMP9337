A new day begins, and Kai Yang woke up. He cleaned up and took the broom lying in the corner of the small room and walked out. Standing at the front door, he stretched a little. He looked up at the touch of grey in the dawn sky and closed his eyes while breathing in deeply. He was enjoying this moment of peace, before reopening his eyes to start sweeping the ground, cleaning away the dirt and leaves.

Dressed in black clothes that were simple and clean. The aged clothing colour for no reason, highlighted the youth’s loneliness and years of isolation here. Kai Yang’s spine was as straight as a javelin, and with his face had a meticulous expression. Even though he was completing the lowest ranked job. His actions were very calm, he didn’t exert much force on the broom, his body didn’t even move that much. With only the rotation of his wrist, the broom moved effortlessly. When his body moved, the dust and trash on the ground seemed to magically accumulate in one place around him, just like they had grown a pair feet.

Kai Yang was the Sky Tower’s experimental disciple. For three he had trained in the school, but he had only reached the tempered body third stage. Yet the other disciples that had entered at the same time as him had long surpassed him and reached higher stages. They were all able to enter into the main building, pay their respects and make advances towards their futures. While he can only lament about his inadequacy in the outer courts.

The tempered body third stage in three years cannot be called bad or good, but really, really mediocre.

Helplessly, Kai Yang could only continue to sweep out here in the outer court. Working hard to support himself and working hard in training.

Sky Tower School is a very unique school. This uniqueness is seen through the ruthless competition between disciples. In the school, the strong are like kings, while the weak are eliminated. The strong eat the weak; the law of the jungle, in the Sky Tower School is actively followed by all.

In other schools you may be able to school friendly competition, brotherly bonds and people working together to achieve the same goal. But in the Sky Tower school, you will only be able to false bonds, in order to use each other and rise in power. Stepping over each other’s bodies is the only way.

Under Sky Tower’s strict system, it’s well-known throughout the entire Han Dynasty. Although the grounds were not that large, but due to the brutal nature of their disciples, their might is second to none! This is also because, each disciples’ skill is like a tiger and walking out, no one in all the rivers and lakes dares to provoke them.

Though the Sky Tower School has one rule. That’s to fourteen year old disciples, the first three years of their acceptance is considered the testing phase. In these three years, all of the disciples food, clothing, shelter are provided by the outer court. Disciples only need to focus on cultivating. If in these three years you can breakthrough the tempered body, then you are able to enter the inner court to pay respects to your elders and become their students. Of course you don’t need to have a teacher and practise on your own, but the difference in learning by yourself and having a teacher is very large. In a way, the Sky Tower rules do have some flexibility and freedom.

In those three years if you don’t break through, then you can either leave the school or be demoted to an experimental disciple.

Experimental disciple is Kai Yang’s current status! He is also Sky Tower School’s shame!

Compared to normal disciples, their treatment is very different. Experimental disciples must provide for their food, shelter, clothing, for the outer court will no longer waste cultivating resources on these trashes. Once demoted to experimental disciples, you basically can never advance. Unless you manage to increase your cultivation level quickly. Only then will the school let you attempt to become a true disciple.

The entire Sky Tower consists of three thousand disciples, while the experimental disciples? You can count them on your ten fingers! Kai Yang has faith that he can become a true disciple!

For experimental disciples who want to survive in Sky Tower, is like wanting to reach the heavens. Take Kai Yang for example, the current hut that he is living in was built by him, one log at a time. The holes on the small roof, he doesn’t even have time to fix them. When it rains, the water can’t exit properly and builds up in the room. He buys his own clothes, his food he got himself, he is responsible for all his own needs.

Kai Yang’s small hut is in the school’s most remote and most uninhabited location.

Generally with such horrendous treatment, it is difficult to endure. That is the reason why the school only has a very small number of these disciples. Most who couldn’t breakthrough the tempered body chose to leave, but Kai Yang stayed.

Already been kicked out, how is ok?

A few months before, when he was made a experimental disciple, Kai Yang accepted a sweeping job to provide for himself.

Right now Kai Yang was both an experimental disciple and the tower’s little sweeping servant. But just by sweeping to maintain a living is hard. There are times when he is cold or hungry, in this life he had chosen this path. Even so, he didn’t play the drums of retreat, because in this this life he had chosen this oath and must continue down it. That was what men did.

In Kai Yang there was toughness, if you don’t hit into the brick wall, then don’t look back type of toughness!

(TLN: Chinese idiom, to continue on with your own decision/idea/plan)

The sky gradually began to light up as he swept. Cleaning the trails, sweeping dust from the space.

Even though sweeping itself didn’t use a lot of energy, but without food or drink since the morning and constantly moving, Kai Yang was covered in sweat. This had nothing to do with strength, by his physique was very poor. Two out of three meals he was hungry. For anybody living like him, how could their physique be good.

Gradually Sky Tower disciples surrounded him. These disciples had woke up early, not to cultivate but to look at him. They had great interest in Kai Yang, looking at him with avid gazes like they were staring at a naked beauty. A sweet fragrance like juicy meat bins wafted.

Among those Tower disciples gathered around Kai Yang, there was also a tense competitive atmosphere in the air. Looking at each other warily, all held an unfriendly look.

Someone in the crowd softly said: “So many people, it’s a bit excessive ah.”

It was that moment they said: “Do you think anybody can walk this path huh. Nobody wants you to stay.”

That statement made the person who spoke embarrassed. For everybody body knew why they were gathered hey, why they were all looking at Kai Yang, all waiting for that moment to come. The deadline was about to arrive, leaving now was not a pity? If you can grab the funds, and today it is also a harvest.

The commotion next to him, Kai Yang naturally knew, though his expression never changed. They will parade themselves every five days, six times a month. He has already gotten used to it, nothing to make a fuss out of. He also noticed the amount of people in front of him had decreased, they probably had not all arrived yet.

(TIN: Wow, these guys are really bothered to come there six times a month. Don’t they have better things to do?)

As he was being discredited, he turned a blind eye to the people next to him and began to sweep.

Following the passage of time, the people around Kai Yang gradually increased. There was roughly thirty-forty people present.

Kai Yang suddenly stopped and sat down in the middle of the road. Slowly he breathed in the early morning air to restore his own physical stamina.

At this movement, the people gathered around him all spread out and surrounded him, with Kai Yang as the centre. A tense atmosphere filled the air, it was as if the air no longer flowed.

No one looked at each other pleasingly, but all looked intensely at Kai Yang.

If people were to see this crowd, they would hold the misunderstanding that expert was in the middle. Or else, how could so many people surround one person like that? In reality, Kai Yang was only a experimental disciple with a tempered body, third stage. Any of the people present, were stronger than him.

“Kai Yang, no need to bother. Why don’t you just obediently lie down on the ground so I can beat you and save some time?” Seeing him like this, they really held disdain.

How much energy can a tempered body third stage restore? You are going to lose anyway, so why linger?

“Hear, Hear. Kai Yang, please think about our fellow disciples feelings too. We are not like you, after this game we need to go practise.”

The statement was to let Kai Yang quickly submit and let them beat him. Making the act of restoring his internal energy disrespectful to them. Though he just turned a deaf ear, like Buddha Lao.

Time continued to pass by, suddenly the melodious Tower bells sounded. It reached the ears of all the disciples surrounding Kai Yang and himself, startling the disciples. The bells tolled nine times, and from the east the sun rose. It was a new day! Everyone’s breathing calmed down, helplessly looking at Kai Yang as he slowly got up. He took up his broom and glanced at the people encircling him.

“Choose me Senior Yang!” Shouted a person. “I strike lightly, I can guarantee you no pain!”

“Rubbish! Choose me, I will be merciful. I will end it in one fist, and I promise not to waste everyone’s time.”

“Pick me......”

“Pick me.......”

It was very clamorous, just like in a marketplace where vendors were trying to sell their produce and competing on whose produce was fresher.

“Kai Yang, you can choose your own opponent!” Someone reminded.

Kai Yang chuckled, readily he lifted his broom and threw it to the sky. The dozens of pairs of eyes looked up, full of expectation, waited for the broom to fall whilst praying: “choose me, choose me!” Time seemed to slow down, the broom turned a few times in the air and immediately fell on the ground with a loud boom, no longer moving.

The broom head pointed into the crowd to a burly teenager. A regretful sound, the crowd full of resentment and resignation. But that burly youngster laughed out loud and rushed out: “Fellow disciples, this brother won this battle today, but hopes fellow disciple do not blame me.”

“Che, lucky bastard!” One jealously said.

“Why couldn’t it choose me, for I come every five days, for a month! Kai Yang you aren’t doing this on purpose are you?”

“Don’t mention it, I have already come for a full three months and not once was I chosen!”

“Brother, you are more miserable than me.”

“Not miserable, not miserable, watching a good good show.” The two brothers looked at each other, smiling secretly to in their hearts.

In the courtyard, the others had already dispersed, leaving only Kai Yang and the burly teenager looking at each other.

“Experimental disciple Kai Yang, tempered body third stage!” Yang Kai introduced to his opponent.

“Ordinary disciple Zhou Ding Jun, tempered body fifth stage!” The burly teenager introduced.

Sky Tower disciples were also ranked. From bottom to top are the ordinary disciples, lower base disciples, elite disciples, and core disciple; the five ranks. Zhou Ding Jun said that he was an ordinary disciple, that means he has yet to pay his respects and doesn’t have a mentor. If the breakthrough of the tempered body disciple had a mentor, then their status would be higher than those ordinary lower base disciples. And those elite disciple were selected from the best lower base disciples.

As for the core disciples, they were treated as the hope of the next generation of the Sky Tower School and thus cultivated accordingly.

The awe-inspiring disciple hierarchy, though it seems unreasonable it can stimulate the younger generation into the fierce sense of competition, which is the foundation of the brutal Tower regime. This is the main reason why Kai Yang fought countless people, another rule of Sky Tower, the Challenge Rule.

In the school there was one rule: All Sky Tower disciples were allowed to be challenged once every five days. Though they could at most be three levels higher, or they were allowed to decline. The winner then be able to gain contribution points, while the loser will have points deducted.

Contribution Points are also known as Main Gate Contribution Points!

In the Sky Tower, contribution points are equivalent to money. If you have enough contribution points, you could exchange them for anything you want, cheats, weapons from the Main Gate Logistics Department. Points can also be exchanged for gold and silver, but generally speaking these contributions were hard-won, and the disciples were generally reluctant to exchange it for that.

There were also many different ways to obtain these points. You can exchange them through the treasure hunt, completing tasks, etc.

The most common way to earn contribution points was to challenge others! The duels were to test their strength against other disciples, and if they won they earned contribution points.

So early in the morning and many people crowded around Kai Yang, it was like staring a ripe persimmon about to fall.

Kai Yang’s name, in the school could be considered famous. Not only because he carried the identity of a trial disciple, but also because he was still in Sky Terrace. Also every time someone challenged him, he lost.

Kai Yang naturally remembered what it the commotion was, today is the fifth day from the last challenge. They who didn’t challenge him previously, could now. Who isn’t jealous? It was basically free contribution points. Although the points gained were not large, it was still enticing, thus many people still came.

In position, Kai Yang shouted out two words, “Please instruct!”

That being said, anyone knew that Kai Yang was in for another beating!

Kai Yang was always the first to attack. Even with his thin body he would always put out an amazing fight, taking the step to Zhou Ding Jun, then punched to the chest. Afterwards a simple and direct attack, then a tiger fist, his attacks were strong and it felt like all of his energy were in his attacks.

In the school, all disciples had to learn the Shaolin Fist. This fist was well-known, a basic move to keep disciples in shape and start them off.

Zhou Ding Jun didn’t panic, because he was stronger than his opponent by two levels. Sadly, this battle didn’t hold any suspense. Kai Yang’s fist was seen coming and easily dodged by that burly body.

Grazing past his clothes, Zhou Ding was unharmed. Punching again, Kai Yang was easily countered and hit in his solar plexus.

Suppressing the pain, Kai Yang quickly retreated and avoided Zhou Ding’s third strike.

“Eh?” This surprised Zhou Ding, he hadn’t thought that his tird stage brother, could actually react fast enough. With this, his future plans were disrupted.

But this small error didn’t affect the situation. Thinking quickly, Zhou Ding took to the occasion to catch Kai Yang unaware.

Unaware, Kai Yang suddenly kicked his right foot forward. Seeing the shadow rapidly approaching, Zhou Ding saw his indomitable spirit, whilst executing a Shaolin fist.

Crap! He heart jumped. Although he had higher cultivation, he was inferior to Kai Yang’s battle experience.

But what would it matter? Even if he couldn’t dodge, he would take it head on.

Two light chuckles were heard, then Kai Yang fell backwards, while Zhou Ding was still standing. If his opponent was at the same cultivation as him, the he would have been the one to fall down.

Others couldn’t see the fists, but they clearly felt it. This disciple was too fast, so in other words he first hit himself then the opponent.

But, it was only his fist that was powerful. This body and health were all too frail, skinny arms, legs and body. Malnutrition was very obvious, thus resulting in this ending.

“Senior, you let me win!” This battle left quite a bitter result in Zhou Ding Jun’s heart. Although he won, he didn’t feel as if he had won.

To the side, many whispers could be heard: “This person thought he won?”

“Ha ha. Doesn’t that mean he didn’t know of Kai Yang’s reputation and challenged him? ”

“This is really too hilarious.”

Zhou Ding furrowed his brow, for really didn’t know of Kai Yang’s reputation. He had heard people talking about him. So today when he saw many people crowding around, he had decided to participate too and was super lucky to be chosen.

Could you not win? His own fist made him go flying, thus making him at a supreme disadvantage. According to the gate rules, he had already lost.

“Again!” After this thought, Kai Yang yet stood up again and without the slightest hesitation but with even more intense spirit.

Without waiting for answer, Kai Yang charged over. Three feet away, he swept his foot towards Zhou Ding’s legs in an attempt to topple him.

A leg whip! The school had disciples cultivate various martials arts. Yet Kai Yang’s application of them far surpassed his peers, even though he knew less techniques.

So you could use a leg whip here.

Then without notice, Kai Yang went flying away again.

With two realms apart, also the gap between physical fitness, Kai Yang was once again defeated. His attack to Zhou Ding’s leg had clearly wounded his own bones, making him falter slightly.

“Again!” He said while clenching his teeth and eyes full of determination.

“Peng.......” Kai Yang flew away again.

“Again!”

“Peng.......” Kai Yang flew away again.

For those who couldn’t watch any longer had left, while the ones who stayed marvelled: “Kai Yang, this guy had real tenacity. No matter how many times he’s beaten down, he just gets back up. He won’t let it go!”

(TLN: ~Let it go~! Let it go~o! Sorry had to do that. :P)

Hearing these words, Zhou Ding felt real bitter. He hadn’t imagined that his opponent was such a crazy person.

So Kai Yang was sent flying another seven or eight times. His face was swollen, eyes were black, staggering around and breathing quite heavily. But he still continued to persist and continue fighting.

Finally Zhou Ding exclaimed: “Are you crazy? Throw down the towel or you’ll die!”

Within the Tower disciples’ internal struggles, every year there are many who die. Zhou Ding Jun seeing this unflinching and courageous brother, couldn’t help but feel a bit alarmed.

When he thought that, Zhou Ding Jun knew he couldn’t reach such a degree and was afraid that he would have to surrender.

Keep your cool, will then you will not be afraid to be burned. This is the way of life, to stubbornly follow your decision. This is perseverance!

Despite Kai Yang’s sorry figure, his eyes were becoming more and more powerful. Zhou Ding Jun knew that if he didn’t settle things now, then there will be no end.

Thinking of this, Zhou Ding Jun rushed forward to execute a palm knife to Kai Yang’s neck bone. Kai Yang with an imposing manner swiftly escaped. Then his eyes clouded and he fell limply to the ground.

Seeing this scene, tens of feet higher, a disciple who was sitting on a tree branch took out a small book. Flipping the page she wrote: Trial Disciple Kai Yang vs. Ordinary Disciple Zhou Ding Jun, Zhou Ding Jun wins.

(TLN: Experimental disciple will now become trial disciple)

The person who was on the tree branch had a graceful figure, it obviously was a woman. It was just that black mask on her face, didn’t allow people to see her face. But those delicate eyebrows, proved that this person was not old. The armband on her arm also indicated her identity, a Sky Tower Dark Hall Disciple!

Sky Tower’s Dark Hall is a special sector; the school’s three main elders were responsible for governing and the hall disciples were responsible for to recording down all affairs of the school, no matter how big or small, all matters are recorded. This also included the results of duels between disciples.

So for all battles within the school, you do not have to worry about not being able to prove your wins and earning contribution points. For in the shadows, dark hall disciples will record them down for you, and summarise your monthly records.

This woman, after recording the outcome for this duel, took out another smaller book from her waist and opened up at May 7th century, 14 years Kai Yang’s 147th defeat.

Even if you remove this, above are numerous records of Kai Yang’s battles. From the first battle to the most recent, all had one word: Defeat!

One hundred and forty seven battles in a row, he had lost every single one of them. This simply can be said that since the school’s history, it was a unique record and was enough to be awe-inspiring. Though the owner of this record was lying on the ground, not knowing if they were dead or alive.

Kai Yang had never challenged others, so these 147 losses were from others challenging him. So to say, from being challenged once every five day, this had last for two years.

Looking at Kai Yang on the ground, she wrinkled her eyebrows. She didn’t understand how Yang kai could endure to this state. He had already become the Tower’s trial disciple, even his very survival was endangered, so why did he still linger? If he had left, then his life will certainly be better. This thin boy, what kind of dedication did he have? Even with 147 straight losses, he remains undaunted.

Perhaps this is a man’s folly? Taking notice of Kai Yang was also a moment’s coincidence. When Xia Ning Chang became a dark hall disciple, she was placed in charge of monitoring this area. Yang Kai was challenged every time, not once, not twice, and every single time she saw him being beaten to near death. Xia Ning Chang, began to pay attention to this tempered body third stage youth.

She was really curious, with his strength, how long could he endure before finally leaving Sky Tower. This type of talent, this type of training speed, he really was not fit to remain here. The ordinary world is his place.

The people below had already long scattered, only Kai Yang was still there on the ground. Coming and going, time passed by.

Xia Ning Chang, disappeared from the branch in a flash.

When Kai Yang woke up, it was already three o’clock. There was nowhere on his body that didn’t hurt. Staggering, he stood up and looked up, only to be surprised. For the place in which he woke up from was under the shade of a tree and not where he fainted.

This was really surprising, was there a fellow disciple that was kind enough to carry him over? This had never happened before, causing Kai Yang to furrow his brows. He could vaguely remember there was a shadowy figure darting in front of him. But memory was too vague, thinking harder just made it more unclear.

But between his current position and the place he fainted, there was very distinct drag marks, clearly showing that he had been dragged over.

Once again he felt his back, immediately flaring hot pain spread out.

Kai Yang froze for a moment, becoming furious! The trace of goodwill he felt towards his benefactor had quickly disappeared. That person directly dragged him over, otherwise how could his back bled like this.

He might as just have left him there on the ground! Kai Yang thought to himself.

Being depressed, Kai Yang realised that in his right hand he was clutching something. Looking down in doubt, he was surprised to find a small, fine work of porcelain in his hand.

What is this? This was definitely not his, for the only things that Kai Yang owned were the clothes on his back and his broom. How could he have this?

The small porcelain bottle had a label. Yang Kau read it out: “Blood Clotting Cream”.

Blood clotting cream, Kai Yang knew of this.

This was the school’s cream to help heal wounds, although it was ordinary, its effects were very good. Generally, disciples will carry one bottle around for emergency uses. this one bottle of cream in Sky Tower Logistics,was very expensive.

Ten points of contribution was the bottle’s cost!

How much contribution points can Kai Yang earn for sweeping for a month? He can only earn ten points, in other words, this one bottle’s worth was equal to one month of work for him.

Who was it? At this moment, the resentment Kai Yang had towards this person was reduced greatly, but as he moved, the pain flared up again. He had already come to this Tower for three years, three years. Within this time, Yang Kai had already gotten used to the lack of compassion between disciples. But today, for this person to leave behind a bottle of blood clotting cream for him, greatly touched Yang Kai’s hearts.

Originally, he had thought all the disciples were cold-blooded people.

Perhaps this bottle of cream was not worth much to them, but to Kai Yang currently, he desperately needed it.

There was a saying, dripping water is grace, is hard to forget even when one’s teeth fall out!

(TLN: Meaning one small kindness must be remembered eternally and returned)

Kai Yang was both grateful and tried to remember who it was. It was becoming harder to remember. He could could only recall the thin strand of fragrance lingering around.

“Was this medicine this fragrant?” Kai Yang pondered.

Calming down and straightening his clothes, he carefully put the bottle away. Kai Yang re-picked up his broom and commenced his work.

Inside and outside all were swept, then at midnight, his work was considered completed. Kai Yang dragged his tired and hungry body back to his hut.

The morning’s battle wounds had yet to be treated. Even when Kai Yang was starving, he could only endure. First treat the injuries then deal with the hunger.

Taking off his clothes, he then carried over a tub of water to wash his body. If someone were to be by his side and look at Kai Yang’s body, they would cry out in shock.

Kai Yang’s bones, along with his ribs were all clearly visible. It was clear that his body didn’t have much flesh on it and lacked nutrition. There were also bruises and scars littering his body everywhere. There was practically no place that wasn’t scarred.

Every five days he was challenged, every time he lost, every time he was knocked unconscious. When old injuries had yet to fade, new ones were added. Switching to any other person, they would be unable to tolerate this pain, but Kai Yang did. Not only did he bear with it, but he continued his daily sweeping, not letting those injuries affect him.

Once his body was clean, Kai Yang picked up the bottle of blood clotting cream and sniffed it a little. He found that the medicine was quite refreshing and lost himself in it and then he shook his to clear it.

Kai Yang opened that bottle, and tried to smear the cream directly onto his injuries but stopped. He hastily went to fetch a new tub of water and then put some of the medicine into the water to dilute it. Stirring carefully, he began his treatment using the diluted formula.

(TLN: Ah, the life of a poor person. Too relatable...T_T)

Enough the effects of the blood clotting cream were good, after diluting it, the effects were also reduced. But Kai Yang only had this one bottle, so naturally he would have to use it sparingly.

After the tub of diluted was used up, Kai Yang had also finished treating his injuries. However, it also left him some doubts. For the paste’s smell was not the same as it was previously and also slightly spicy.

Putting his clothes back on, he went to get the dark coloured sweet potato and wolfed it down. Kai Yang then plonked down on his bed, and soon fell asleep.

The holes in the small roof, allowed some light to seep in, lighting up the hut. The hut was extremely sparse, there was no table or chairs. Only one small bed with a deerskin blanket and square shaped pillow. This was all of Kai Yang’s possessions.

The deerskin, was from a deer Kai Yang hunted previously. Although it was not thick, it was still warm. While his pillow was from his time outside the school when he was hunting, he happened to pick up.

Pillow was a square, a foot long and three fingers thick. It looked like stone, felt like one but didn’t bear the weight a stone should. Kai Yang didn’t know what it was, but used it as a pillow, and didn’t investigate further.

This blackstone pillow had already been with Kai Yang for a year already, yet he still didn’t know what it was. Nonetheless, it was a great pillow.

Fast asleep, Kai Yang dreamt of today’s battle. Time and time again he was hit flying away by Zhou Ding Jun. And time and time again he would stand back up, persevering and continuing with a blood crest on his chest.

As the dream continues the blood crest became more and more powerful. Kai Yang’s sleeping face was clench up in pain, but you could see it was resolute. He only had one goal in his heart; to succeed. Even if he was ordered to cut off his foot or fry his body in flames, he would not cower in fear.

The unconscious Kai Yang didn’t take notice that the pillow below his had started to exclude a clouded light that corresponded with his moods. This light became more and more luminous.

In the dream, Kai Yang continued with his early morning encounter with Zhou Ding Jun; repeatedly getting knocked to the ground. At his thousandth time of getting knocked and getting back up, with his unwavering will suddenly broke through. He rushed mercilessly towards Zhou Ding Jun, who immediately fell to the ground. Zhou Ding Jun’s figure then became hazy and morphed into his own figure.

At this moment Kai Yang’s mind calmed down, though it wasn’t due to him beating his opponent, but he winning against himself. Winning against his inner fear and yielding heart.

A faint feeling gradually rose up, there is no longer anything under the sky that can make him submit to them.

In reality, the black pillow under Kai Yang’s head suddenly burst forth a black ray. This black ray emerged from the black stone and hovered in the air for a bit before drilling into Yang Kai’s head. Instantly disappearing from sight.

At the same time, in an ancient and desolate place a strange presence descended. Like tidal waves, the collapse of snow, any person in front of him was insignificant that strange presence thought.

Kai Yang suddenly opened his eyes, his whole body sweating and bursting with fear.

He was awoken by that strange presence.

Calming himself, he forced a smile. When was dreaming, he could actually scare himself like that, it’s ridiculous. Rubbing his face, he looked up into the night sky to determine the time, and was annoyed. He had only slept for two hours, seeing it was quite dark outside.

Hurriedly he got up, folded up the deerskin blanket and re-positioned the blackstone pillow. As he got up, he frowned and turned to look back at the pillow.

This feeling......his gut told him that it was not the same.

Under doubts, Kai Yang reached out towards the pillow and picked it up. He was correct, its weight had decreased a lot.

Strange, how can this block stone, suddenly become so light? Questioning this, more questions started to appear.

It was like a thick book was being thrown into the air, with the pages spread out as it landed. Kai Yang was flabbergasted, momentarily forgetting to catch it.

Pa, the blackstone pillow fell to the ground and opened up like a book. He couldn’t believe it, even though it was spread out in front of him.

Wasn’t this a stone? How could it suddenly turn into a book?

The Blackstone pillow had been with Kai Yang for over a year already, he was very clear. Did he not previously find a blackstone and not a book? Did an old turtle take off his shell and become a snake?

A while ago when he stooped down to pick up the book, and he immediately felt a connection with it.

Looking at it again, he really had to admit it was the pillow he was using. This thick book, left him speechless, though there were no words. It was empty. But the books pages couldn’t let him see through it. He gently tried to tear a page, but he couldn’t tear it at all.

It really makes him rethink. He had owned it for an entire year, and only just discovered its true colours.

But such an empty black book, what is its use? He inspected the book all over, and still nothing.

Mysterious. Kai Yang turned to the first page, and nothing. Staring at the blank book page.

With little effort, he still found little change to the page. Then he discovered there was a little change to the page. The strange presence that appeared in the desolate place of his dreamed had appeared again. A line of golden coloured characters had started to appear.

“Blood is cited, the golden body descends, not a miracle, but a golden immortal!”

This penetrated deep into the soul, which caused Kai Yang to slam the book shut, with his limbs shaking uncontrollably. Breathing deeply, he managed to calm his heart down a bit.

What secrets did this black book hide? He didn’t know at all, but he knew that this object he obtained from Black Wind Mountains contains great history.

After a long period of silence, he once again opened the black book. This time, he read the first line on the page.

Turns out.........it wasn’t a dream.

Gradually, other lines slowly appeared.

“Proud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!”

Eight lines and thirty-two words occupied an entire page. Giving one a dominating heavenly and earthly feeling, as if those words were imbued with domineering spirit.

These thirty-two words’ meanings were very easy to understand. Naturally Kai Yang understood.

But the black book’s history was unclear, thus he was a bit afraid. What if this was a trap of some sort? Thinking of this he laughed at himself, for currently he was only a trials disciple of Sky Tower’s. Who would go to the effort of taking care of him?

From just looking at the last couple of lines and their meaning, the reason why the blackstone pillow will turn into a black book was probably because of his dream tonight.

For over one year, the pillow didn’t change, then suddenly after that dream it turned into a book. They must be connected.

Is it because of his own change that also changed the blackstone pillow.

Since it was I who led to the book’s birth, then this black book was born for me! Thus, I am this black book’s owner!

Thinking of this, Kai Yang hesitated no more. The writing clearly on the book clearly states that he must drip blood in order to lead. Thinking of this, he bit onto his finger hardly and dripped a drop of blood on to the page.

Drip, drip. The blood went onto the page, but there was no apparent change. After a fair amount of time passed, from the page, black light started to emerge. His body immediately felt unwell, for the injuries from earlier today had started to sear in pain. His head had also started to hurt.

Biting down on his teeth, he continued to endure. His blood continued to flow, and the light on the book was becoming brighter and brighter.

After a large amount of time and effort, Kai Yang nearly fainted. But there had been substantial change to the book, and the black light had started to wiggle and contract. And from the center of the page, a tiny vortex had appeared.

Following that, from within the vortex a golden swirl could be seen. Kai Yang put great effort to maintain a clear mind, staring intently to the transformation in front of him.

Within the black vortex, a small, round, shiny, black object gradually came out.

He was shocked, for there really was something in the the book. Even though while he was dripping his blood, he had some expectations, he didn’t think that is was actually true.

But right now, right in front of him, the thirty-words from before were not false.

Blood is cited, the golden body descends!

So, what kind of golden body is it? Anticipation covered his pale face.

After a while, after the shiny, round thing had fully appeared in front of him, he couldn’t help but swallow a mouthful of saliva. How matter how rich his imagination was, he wouldn’t have thought that the golden body would be like this.

This thing was about 30 cm high golden skeleton, and to think the first thing that came out was this skeleton’s skull. The golden skull just floated on top of the book page, sitting crossed legged like it was mediating. Every bone lighting up Kai Yang’s tiny hut.

The black vortex on the page slowly began to recede and everything reverted back to its tranquil state.

Kai Yang had watched this strange golden skull appeared, for a time did not know how to react. On page said only how to get the golden body out, but didn’t say what to do after it came out.

Looking at it, he thought there wasn’t something right. The golden skeleton in front of him had no eyes, but he felt like it looked like his own. It obviously didn’t have any mouth but was clearly mocking its weakness.

Thinking of this, Kai Yang was furious and went to pick it up.

This small, insignificant skeleton dares to be arrogant!

He didn’t think that when he went to reach out for it, the golden skeleton flew out towards him. Flying past his hand and embedded himself on his chest.

This was a bit of a horror. With a skeleton smashing onto his chest, he cried out and then the skeleton started to emit a fluorescent light, and penetrated deep into the pores of Kai Yang’s limbs.

Suddenly, pain exploded all over his body, but the pain was not an ordinary pain, but the pain from the depths of the bone! He breathed in painfully, fell to the ground, his body bent like shrimp, with waves of cramps.

His whole body’s bones shattered in that moment, and he couldn’t even lift a finger, for he had no strength. This was not an illusion, if you could see into his body, then you can see his bones being crushed, and next to each crushed bone, there was a layer of gold wrapped around. Continuously repairing the broken bones, but far slower than the damage speed. When the repair was finished, it was crushed again.

Human bones wrap around bone marrow and bone marrow nerve. Any small touch to them can bring great harm. One can only imagine his suffering at that moment.

In his body, not a single bone wasn’t shattered.

Even for others, even if their strength of thousands of times higher than his, they would have probably fainted now. But with Kai Yang, he could only feel the pain a thousand fold right now.

Tragic cry came from the hut, not far away a fellow disciple was out for a walk was frightened by the cry and quickly ran away.

Form somewhere, he received a message that came from this golden body: Destroy Kai Yang’s consciousness, and seize his body!

Did Kai Yang agree? Even if he was unable to move, but also struggled to maintain the awareness, he will never let golden body take over the magpie nest. The golden body felt fear, so over and over again crushed Yang Kai’s bones, tortured his nerves, so that he fainted thereon.

One is a proud golden statue, another with an indomitable spirit, who wins who loses, one cannot see the outcome.

Kai Yang knew that right now it was really important, unlike the previous challenges with his fellow disciples. If this was the past him, then he would have given up but now he will not. Even if it hurts like hell will endure.

His consciousness, the golden body’s destructive power, both commenced a hard tug of war. And the battlefield is the Kai Yang’s body, you pull, I pull, each not letting an inch go.

Over time, Kai Yang was surprised to find that the intolerable pain was slowly reducing, help lift his spirits and fill him full of energy.

It’s no wonder, after Kai Yang and the golden body clashed time and time again, the numerous crushing of his bones had strengthened them. With his bones becoming stronger and stronger, and the golden body’s powers becoming weaker and weaker, the pain thus naturally alleviated. The struggle will soon end.

With the scales tipping in his favor, the unbearable pain slowly became bearable. Transforming into light tickles, then becoming like splashes of cold water. This feeling was like applying cream, allowing his millions of pores to open and relax.

Aware of the golden body’s desperate struggle, made Kai Yang furious. Cursing loudly, he crushed that presence within him.

Inside his body, it had finally calmed down.

A sigh could be heard, a sigh full of comfort and trace of great relief.

He after quietly lying on the ground for more than an hour, Kai Yang stood up, for he had just used up all his strength.

An hour before, Kai Yang felt it was like a dream. He really could not believe this was true.

Quietly he punched himself and felt the pain.

“In the end what it is, what history does this black book have?” He muttered to himself in helplessness.

Waiting until his heart stopped beating, he suddenly found himself somewhat different from before. For he couldn’t eat three, fulfilling meals a day, and every five days he would suffer beatings. Thus his body bones are weak, but now he clearly perceived that his bones were full of vitality. A surge of energy, filled with warmth, slowly circulated inside and outside, his body.

Moving slightly, the bones burst out a crystal-clear sound. Making it seem like a melody being played. And he who was hurt today, couldn’t feel the pain anymore.

Aware of this, Kai Yang quickly roll up his sleeves, and opened his clothes. Looking closely, he found that his body no longer had any bruises and injuries. They had actually all disappear, even those old wounds were healed.

Feeling as unblemished as a newborn baby!

Rubbing the places that previously held wounds, dead skin fell. This revealed the new tender skin underneath, like a baby’s but far more healthier.

“I cry ......” He swallowed down a cold lump, thinking of that golden skeleton in his body had such a strong recovery ability!

Then feeling his own strength and found that he was still at the tempered body third stage with no change. This discovery somewhat made him a little disappointed.

Rivers and allusions, with secrets known only to insiders, this type of story Kai Yang heard much during his childhood. He knew in world there are many men eligible to jump past the dragon gate, becoming powerful and famous.

But after all it’s just a story. How many people can really be happy and gain such luck and results in this world? Those senior experts with greater strength, the more I could not bear to lower themselves with earth and buried. Always finding inheritor before death. I want to jump off a cliff drill a cave and encounter events, such unlikely things will happen?

But the current problem had happened to him. That black must have great background, and that old golden skeleton must be extraordinary.

This can be said as his good fortune. It could also be said as fate.

The four sentences on the black book’s first page: Proud golden body, rules the fence, indomitable spirit, will it descend!

If he didn’t pick up the black book, but another picked it up, they too will treat it was garbage. Unable to prise open like Mt. Tai. Precisely because he picked it up, and used it as a pillow for a year, it felt his body’s unyielding and tough nature. Unlocking the of the secret black book today.

In other words, this thing really is his first encounter, but it’s the first achievement that he obtained through his own hands. Thought of this, Kai Yang sudden burst comfortable, is called the BMW with a good saddle, beauty gifts hero

......

“That black book.” Thinking of it suddenly, this book that was his pillow for over year. He wasn’t anxious to find out what it was nor how he found it.

Between being anxious, and somewhat weakened in the body, the black book abruptly appeared in front of Kai Yang, and snapped shut, falling to the ground.

He was stunned. Picking up the book, he furrowed his eyebrows while thinking hard. Struck by with an idea, a move from his hands the book disappeared. And a further move, made it appear again.

This scene was like a magic trick. One could see that Kai Yang’s face was very solemn, because he truly felt, that the black book could escape into his body with a single thought.

“This black book possibly......be made from a soulstone!” After saying it, he nearly gave himself a fright.

A soulstone! This was considered a legendary gem.

Only when hundreds of millions of ghost gather in the abyss and with the help of vast amounts of human vitality, will it start to form.

Rumor has it, that this is how is was formed.

Inside the blackstone, with misery of a hundred million lives, the living cannot enter, and green grass can’t think to grow!

Those words were somewhat exaggerated. But for a soulstone about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm to form, how many lives must be taken? The formation of this mythical rock was really cruel and bloody. What every life near it during its creation, will be dead within milliseconds.

Also the formation time is unimaginable, it could that up to a millennium or even ten millenniums.

Putting the formation process aside, this soulstone can be considered a supreme treasure. That is because it has a very unique ability, for it can be melded with one’s body and also open up a dimension. This space is quite flexible, storing things will be no hassle.

Even though Kai Yang is only a trial disciple, a humble position, his experiences were not lacking. Not to mention, the story of the legendary soulstone has been around more many years, anyone would know the story.

When he just obtained this black book, he didn’t think about this. Thinking about how the books went into his body, he thought about how the golden skeleton came out from the book. How could he not recognise the book’s material?

He immediately started sweating.

Soulstones were the things of legends, long extinct in the world. He didn’t think that he will be able to encounter one, let alone such a large one!

The legends only talked about 3.5cm x 3.5 cm sized soulstones, for it was only found that large. Even at that size, it was priceless. But the only in front of him, was somehow made into a black book, that was 30 x 7 cm!

It’s value......was immeasurable!

If this news were to spread out, even if it’s the entire Han Dynasty, not mention a mere martial school, they will probably be crushed overnight to obtain it.

Kai Yang couldn’t help but feel his hands heat up. This heart had not forgotten the terror, but luckily it could be taken into his body. Otherwise he would be in great danger.

His body hiding this treasure, he swiftly escaped back into his hut. He dared not to be carelessly, while his heart beated madly.

He was becoming more and more excited, whilst also becoming more and more uneasy.

HIs strength was currently too low, so how could he guard this treasure? Even though the black book could be taken into his body, eliminating chances of being discovered. This didn’t lessen the worry in his heart.

Only practise, only the strong will be able to protect what is theirs! Thinking about what happened three years ago, Kai Yang’s eyes gradually calmed down.

All on his, without any support he came to this school. What is not for practise and strength?

Even though he obtained this book, he took it into his hands. On the first page was the proud Golden Body. Even though he didn’t know what use it had, it couldn’t be useless. This book also had so many pages, it couldn’t only possess this one Golden Body?

Although Kai Yang is only fifteen this year, due to his experiences these past three years, he is far more mature than his peers. It is also because of this, that he forged this unyielding character.

So when he calmed down, sitting on his bed he carefully started to read the first page.

After confirming there were no extra things popping out of the first page, he started to read the second page.

With his previous experiences, his actions seemed more natural and knowledgeable. And then Kai Yang’s eyes slowly widened as golden words emerged on the dark pages

“Proud Golden Body: Tempered Body Record!”

Previously his mood had dropped but now it soared. Sure enough, as he suspected, every page had something hidden

Almost without thinking, Kai Yang’s entire mind was focused on the second page of the book.

Abruptly, the golden characters flew off the pages like a fish and swiftly drilled themselves in Kai Yang’s brain. The glow enveloped the darkness around him and then disappeared. After it was gone, he felt as if his brain had gained new information. This had all come from the golden characters.

Calming his heart, Kai Yang closed his eyes and began to digest the information.

In fact, he didn’t need to digest and absorb the information. For when the characters imprinted themselves into his brain, he was already able to comprehend their meaning with ease. A full mastery in another sense.

“This is the tempered body record.” Yang Kai muttered, for he found that it was a fist technique.

Though it may seem simple, in reality it was not. In order to perform it, there were strict requirements. For it is extremely profound. In order to cultivate it, you must be facing the rising sun, in the east, to learn it.

So at most, you could only practise for half an hour a day.

Currently it was night, so he had to wait at least five-six hours to start. This frustrated Kai Yang, for he had exerted himself all day and only ate one measly sweet potato. Nonetheless, he had obtained a priceless treasure, and was jubilant.

Aftering trying to sleep for half an hour, he decided to analyse the third page of the black book.

But it just let him down, no matter how much he checked and flipped, there were no changes to the page. While doing this, he fell asleep.

When Yang Kai then woke up, it was nearly sunrise. The pre-dawn darkness was clouded and stillness covered the whole area, with the occasional insect and bird noises.

With his heart looking forward to what was going to happen, Kai Yang quickly leapt out of bed, and went to the front of the cabin. Standing there, he took a few deep breaths and let his body slowly relax.

Oriental? A touch of gray dawn appeared, then he opened his eyes. The set of instructions on the fist technique was practised countless, hundreds of times.

His hands shaped into a palm. With a gentle, slow movement, pushing to the left, to the right, pushing forward. Embracing the world in his mind, everything in between the palm, the vast land, even the air covering the moon and stars.

Left foot forward, right next to the horizon, the right foot stepped powerfully like the king of the underworld. Between breaths, the world full was full of vitality, like spring flowers blooming.

The autumn wind blew, like a golden message. Then the cold wind whistled by, signalling the coming of snow, ice, cold snow.

Yang Kai’s look gradually deepened, slowly his fists pressed on the hefty rocks. In any case, the rock didn’t hint at opening any time soon.

With a burst of sound, Kai Yang with a pale face, suddenly staggered, nearly fell to his knees.

While exercising countless times in his mind, he discovered that this art was an absolute fist. Kai Yang never expected this record actually contained such mysterious quenching body technique.

For just that short while, Kai Yang felt that the entire world was weighing on his shoulders. But he also felt that he could sense all things in the world, under this pressure.

This quenching body record, was not the practise of fist techniques. It was the practise of worldly transformation and the fate of the world. This practice was full of ups and downs, joys and sorrows. A slow punch and kick in, could affect the power of heaven and earth, but also was full of secret rules.

When he launched a six palms, it took three steps. This result wasn’t even one percent of the result recorded in the book. Just that, had been difficult to sustain. Then a crack emitted from his spine, making him believe that he broke his spine.

He Quickly inspected it, but only found that his back was in some pain. It wasn’t anything big.

Steeling his mind, Kai Yang once again started to practise according to the tempered body record.

Because he wasn’t psychologically prepared, Kai Yang‘s mind was in a trance. Feeling unclear, he held his breath to regain a clear mind. Accompanied by a slow dance of his fists, Kai Yang once again felt his mind had become clear and regained the atmosphere required to continue.

Then his body emitted several indistinct feelings, Kai Yang was uncertain as to what they were. Not only that, with the routine deployment, his fist was actually heavier, like being at the bottom of the ocean. With more hardships, there were more improvements.

Kaka sounds could be heard. Kai Yang’s every action, made his bones explode like firecrackers. Excruciating pain permeated throughout his body, but he was unmoved. His tenacity at this moment vividly appeared.

In the blink of an eye, Kai Yang felt his hands and feet tremble like they were beaten to pulp. It was like heaven and earth both imposed themselves on his body.

Persisting, he didn’t falter.

Suddenly a warmth surged, alleviating the pain within his body in this moment. Spirits lifted, he restarted practise. He knew that this must have been due to the integration of the golden skeleton. After all, both of these things came from the same place.

In front the sun rising, near a cabin in a remote place of the school stood a sweating young man. Diligently practising, slow fists and discovering his future.

Half an hour passed when Kai Yang suddenly felt light. He no longer felt the heavy pressure on his body. Right at this moment, he could no longer continuing cultivating this skill.

The record was very clear, you could only cultivate for half an hour everyday at sunrise.

His effort seemed to have drained him. Thus Kai Yang fell to the ground in a heap and took a deep breath. A surge of purple gas accompanied his breath and disappeared. In an instant, he felt refreshed and energised.

Looking distracted, he couldn’t help but but be shocked.

Atmosphere sense! He had already developed a sense to the atmosphere. That is to say, he had broken through the tempered body third stage and was entering the fourth stage?

This news made him elated. Since entering Sky Tower, it took three years of practicing to reach the third stage. But after thirty minutes of practising, the mysterious quenching body technique had let him break through and enter the fourth stage.

The tempered body had nine stages. Until the third stage, it really just enhanced one’s physical capabilities. But after the fourth stage, it would generate a presence within the meridians.

Only with the birth of atmosphere sense, are you considered a true cultivator.

Although at this time you will have the atmosphere sense, the body will still have no real strength. You could only wait for the seventh stage, where the body will develop its own strength, all the way until the ninth stage. That is when the body breaks through and opens / creates a door to strength to the Kai Yuan Boundary. Only then will you truly have strength.

Kai Yuan Boundary, is a true warrior’s start.

Everything in the tempered body territory, was laying the foundations for the future of the Kai Yuan Boundary . This foundation was not finalized, like with a man’s strength. For your bones, skin would grow continuously, until you reach the peak.

Kai Yang had just having entered the fourth stage, and obtained atmosphere sense. To outsiders, this may not seem like much, but to him it was great news and progress.

Half an hour after he broke through, the results of quenching body record were evident. Although his own knowledge contributed, if not for that technique, he believed that he needed another three-four months before advancing.

With this, he breathed in deeply and exhaled out the impurities in his body.

From within his mouth, out came a pitch-black smoke. Filthy, as it tumbled to the ground. After expectorating this smoke out, his six senses all became more acute and sharpened.

(TLN: He’s been possessed by a demon! [Supernatural style] Senses: Sound, touch, sight, taste, smell and sixth sense [instinct])

Was this his body’s impurity? Kai Yang shook on the spot.

With the practise of cultivation you will reduce and drain the body of impurities each time. Kai Yang previously had experienced this, but never at this level.

Numerous ideas and joy lingered in his mind. Although he had successfully entered the fourth layer, he had made no real progress in the tempered body record’s fist technique. His daily practise could only produce one percent of the total result, out of the 101 punches.

Hasty men don’t eat hot tofu and with a hasty heart, you won’t be able to feel a hot butt.

(TLN: Saying that have patience and results will come, if you rush you will miss things.)

Thinking for awhile, Kai Yang planned a bit of his future. Even though it wasn’t thorough, he could no longer be like how he had been, taking each step as it came. For after awhile, you couldn’t help but become impatient.

Then after eating something he continued to sweep the area.

Although he was a sweeper, it didn’t mean that he needed to sweep the entire school. He was only responsible for one tenth of the school. Even though it was cumbersome, it would only take an hour or so.

Within the trees, Xia Ning Chang had started to monitor the disciples and inadvertently saw Kai Yang sweeping away. To not have some emotions would be weird. Today, there was something different about him, but she wasn’t sure. For over half an hour, he hadn’t left that spot, sweeping it until it was shiny and spotless. It was so slick that if a mosquito were to go on, it would have a sprained ankle.

(TLN: Trying to express how clean it is. This author has a major issue with mosquitos I say.)

This guy........Xia Ning Chang didn’t know what to do with him.

At that moment, Kai Yang was thinking about other things. Yesterday he had obtained a huge opportunity, so naturally he was considering his future. But no real options were found. He could only continue to practise at sunrise everyday, for now.

While he was pondering, rapid footsteps approached quickly from behind. He quickly went to dodge, but didn’t realise that the other party was making preparations to avoid him too. So they crashed into each other.

Though he didn’t sustain any major injuries, when he crashed into that person, it felt as if he had crashed into a steel wall. With a cry, he fell to the ground and the place he bumped felt numb.

Kai Yang quickly recovered and apologetically asked: “This fellow disciple, are you okay?”

The young man was annoyed and when he looked up to see that it was Kai Yang, that explosive anger dissipated. Holding anger for such person held no meaning and it was also his own fault.

Replying immediately while waving his hands: “It’s alright, it’s alright!”

While saying this and getting up, he then energetically ran away.

Kai Yang asked: “Fellow disciple, where are you going to hurriedly?”

The young man faintly shouted: “The Contribution Hall, where else?”

Listening to his words, Kai Yang realised that today was already the eighth day of the month. It was the day where the main gate distributed last month’s contribution points!

So every month of this day, the Logistics Department would be crowded with disciples flocking to collect their points. With these points they could exchange them for various cultivation pills, treasures and martial arts to improve their strength. So this day made all disciples all excited.

Some were excited, while others disappointed. Kai Yang was of the latter.

Startled, he couldn’t help but frown. Each month, the amount of points he received was quite meager.

Sweepers could earn ten points, but in the last month he was challenged six times, and each time he lost! With reductions after each loss, he was only left with four points.

This......this really made people cry.

Fortunately he was only a trial disciple. His status was the lowest, so if he lost, he would only lose one point. Normal disciples lost two!

Thinking of this, Kai Yang was thankful.

But even a small mosquito has flesh. And with his savings, he will one day earn enough to exchange them for something worthwhile.

(TLN: Again, what does the author have with mosquitos?)

There had been enough delay today he thought as he continued to sweep.

When he had finally finished the job, it was noon. Time to go to the hall to collect his points.

After the morning’s bustle, the hall was now deserted and quiet. Thankfully he hadn’t came in the morning, or the wait would have been too troublesome.

Waltzing into the hall, you could clearly see an old man dozing away.

This old man was the treasurer of the school. He was about fifty with thin white hair and a kind face. Looking at him, he looked harmless to animals and humans, but Kai Yang knew he was a sly fox!

There was once an elite disciple who dared to act arrogant here and was then pushed out of the hall a few hundred feet. His life was almost taken. Kai Yang was present, so he knew this and also knew that his old man held unfathomable strength.

Stepping into the view of the old man, Kai Yang could clearly see the old man snoring away.

This old thing! Don’t know which female Sky Tower disciple he is dreaming about again!

(ED: Doesn’t even give the old guy the benefit of the doubt O.o)

Holding a broom, he gently nudged the old man while softly calling: “Treasurer Meng!”

The old man’s surname was Meng, his first name Kai Yang didn’t know so he couldn’t call him that.

Tapping the counter a few times, the old man was finally awoken. He groggily opened up his eyes and saw that it was Kai Yang. Wrinkling his face as if he saw s**t.

(TLN: For young viewers, just in case.)

“What’s with that face?” Kai Yang asked indignantly.

Rolling his eyes: “Why didn’t you come in the morning?”

Confidently he replied: “There were too many people in the morning, and currently it’s peaceful!”

“Interrupting this old man’s rest. Do you know what respecting the elderly means?”

Leaning in, Kai Yang whispered: “Which young lady did you dream of?”

Suddenly full of energy Treasurer Meng replied to Kai Yang with eyes full of contempt and loudly proclaimed: “Your words just now, tarnished this old man’s reputation! Too outrageous.”

“Good body figure?”

“Great!” Treasurer Meng unconsciously leaked out.

(ED: GG I had high hopes but alas they were shattered.)

“Supple legs, white skin and a beautiful, thin waist?”

“En, en, en.......” Immediately he nodded his head, immediately thinking Kai Yang as a friend.

“He, he......” Kai Yang sneered.

Treasurer Meng stammered and blushed as bright as a monkey’s ass. Full of shame, he just wanted to dig a hole and crawl inside to hide.

Throughout his years at Sky Tower, the only person Kai Yang really knew was Treasurer Meng. After all, he needed to go to him every month.

Treasurer Meng had a nickname which most people referred to him as, Bully Meng. Even though his position is a treasurer, he still liked to extort contribution points from other disciples.

Take blood clotting cream for example, usually it would be sold around ten contribution points. He will sell two bottles for the price of three. Also the amount of cream that should go in two bottles, was put into three. It’s very simple he said, buy it or get lost!

Of course Treasurer Meng doesn’t always do it, only occasionally. He only targets richer disciples, for poor people like Kai Yang he doesn’t even bother.

Contribution points are hard to come by, so how can disciples stand by and be exploited? Every disciple that had been cheated by him would report him to the council. They have warned him numerous times, but he still continued, unmoved. Furthermore, his position is crucial, and there was no one who could replace him.

Due to this, all of the school’s disciples hated him to the utmost limit.

That old man was ruthless to everybody, except Kai Yang, to whom he could do nothing. That was because one time, he was peeking at a female disciple, and was caught red-handed by him.

No respect for the elderly! What a scandal! He was caught, so Treasurer Meng could only lower his head in front of Kai Yang.

It was exactly because of this that Kai Yang became very familiar with the old man.

The lecherous old man, with thick skin quickly adjusted his attitude and said: “Same as always?”

(TLN: For those who don’t know, thick skin is being very shameless)

“Yeah.” Kai Yang said earnestly while nodding his head.

Not saying a word, Treasurer Meng took out ten silvers from within the counter and recorded it down.

Taking the silvers, he asked: “How many contribution points do I have now?”

Rolling his eyes, the treasurer replied: “You earn four points each month and then use one point to exchange for 10 silvers. That leaves you with only three points to save, making a total of twelve points in your account. What, you want to exchange them for a bottle of blood clotting cream?”

“No, I was just asking.” He replied while muttering: “Twelve eh.”

Such a small amount, even if you just wanted to exchange it for a small medicinal herb, it wouldn’t even be enough.

With a serious face, Treasurer Meng whispered to him: “Little Kai Yang, you want to save up and exchange it for a tempered essence pellet. But to save up for it, and then to rank up with your speed, how long will that take?

“Won’t I eventually reach it?” He replied chuckling.

This left Treasurer Meng speechless. He thought that with his speed, by the time he makes it, this old man will have already been dead for many years.

“But Treasurer Meng, there is one thing I don’t understand.”

“Speak!” The old man said while putting on a ‘I am in a good mood so I will tell you’ attitude.

“The tempered essence pellet is a very precious medicine, how could it appear here?”

“He he........” Speaking with a proud face: “That is because this pellet is this old man’s treasure, others don’t know about it.”

“Ah, it’s yours?” This left Kai Yang stunned. He had always thought that this pellet belonged to the school. No wonder this old thing set such an astronomical price.

“Now don’t be angry.” He joyfully said, while taking a drink from the teapot. “I won’t bully you, as long as you bring enough contribution points to exchange, Old Meng will give it to you. For my word is not nothing.”

“I will collect it.” He said nodding.

With his face downcast Old Meng asked Kai Yang: “I heard that yesterday you got a beating?”

Immediately Kai Yang turned around and left.

From behind Treasurer Meng shouted: “Let this old man ask, don’t be in such a hurry to walk away.”

He said, but really he was gloating inside.

Seeing that Kai Yang had no intention to stop, he straightened up and yelled: “Little Kai Yang, you should hurry up and leave. Sky Tower is no place for you to be, sooner rather than later you will be killed.”

Pausing but without turning around Kai Yang sighed: “I have no place to return to.”

He was finished if he left.

After holding the teapot for a while, Treasurer Meng said: “Then why did you come?”

Tempered essence pellet.......he he, this expensive treasure, how could this old man possibly own it? He only made up this lie to give you hope, he had never thought you would take it seriously.

Kai Yang then hurriedly went back to his hut and put the broom away, then briskly walked out.

He was going to the small village outside of Tang Lin to buy his food with his ten slivers, like he did every month.

For the first time this trip didn’t make him feel tired.

Previously, every time he walked down this path, he would get bad asthma attacks again and again. But this time, not only did this not happen, his body felt strengthened compared to before felt less strained walking down the path. Even if he walked a hundred miles, he felt that he wouldn’t tire.

Is it the golden skeleton? This made him think of something that happened this morning. While he was sweeping, another disciple had crashed into him, but on the contrary to what normally occurred he had held his ground very stably, while the disciple had fell to the ground.

Although this wasn’t much, in retrospect, it was unusual. With his weak physique, how could he not have fallen but the other party fell. It had always been him who fell.

Growing more and more excited, he thought about the changes the golden skeleton had brought to his body. Although these changes were small, gradually over the course of time they could culminate into great changes.

Thinking of this, Kai Yang recovered and soon walked to town.

Looking around, he went to the left hand side of the street. He was going to a rice shop. The shop wasn’t big and the owner is surnamed He, and was a local resident. He treated all customers the same this was one of the reasons why Kai Yang bought from him.

Such a small store could be found everywhere. The reason why Black Plum Village was very busy, was because in the surrounding area, apart them there was not only Sky Tower School but also the Windy Rain Sect. The relationship between the two could not be considered bad. The various other small schools couldn’t compare to these two main sects for they didn’t even own their own land.

It was precisely because of these two main sects that the village was able to sell many different weapons and maintain such a bustling environment full of many different wares.

Creating an environment just like the Han Dynasty’s Capital!

After walking around for awhile, Kai Yang inadvertently walked past an alley where some people were gathered. He didn’t know what they were doing, but they were pretty suspicious and gave Kai Yang an extremely vicious glare.

Chuckling lightly, he just followed the principle ‘if they don’t don’t harm me I won’t harm them’ he just ignored them. But among those three there was one who dressed in a similar fashion to Kai Yang.

Kai Yang didn’t think much of this though, because they were in Black Plum Village, located close to Sky Tower, other disciples coming down to the Village was quite common.

A little while ago, Kai Yang arrived at the line for rice. The line was quite long, the length of two stalls. The business was very prosperous, but only has one waiter running around serving. The boss was calculating about money on an abacus at the counter, while the wife greeted the guests.

As more people finished ordering, the line gradually became shorter and Kai Yang joined the line.

“Madame” Kai Yang cried out, a 40 year old looking lady looked up to see who it was. When she saw it was Kai Yang she suddenly smiled and said, “Ah, young man, you came to buy rice again.”

“Yes.” He walked to the front of the counter, and pointed a bag behind the counter and said “Give me one bag please.”

While the lady was tying up the bag with a string she said “Young man, you buy just one bag a month, is this enough for you?”

Kai Yang replied, “It’s enough.”

“You’re lying!” The lady retorted while looking at Kai Yang ,”Look at you; such thin arms and legs. If you’re eating properly then what’s with the skinny arms and legs?”

Yang Kai smiled sheepishly, “I also go to the mountains to hunt, so therefore even with just one bag I won’t be hungry.”

While the boss concentrated on calculating the bill, he whispered to her: “Go fetch the old rice from the back and give it to this child.”

“We’ll listen to the boss.” Madame replied with a smile.

“How is this right? You are also trying to make a living here.” Yang Kai said out loudly.

The Lady immediately frowned her face, “What use is old rice? Leaving it there will only provide a place for insects to grow. Anyways, people won’t eat it. But the owner said that this rice still has some nutrients although less. You wait here I will go get some for you take home.”

As she was saying this she had already started walking towards the back room.

Kai Yang’s heart swelled, for he didn’t know what to say. Everytime he came to buy rice, the boss and his wife would always find various excuses to give him more. They say that insects will grow in old rice and the like, but in fact, it was always good rice they gave him not old rice. Their generosity gave Kai Yang hope in this sad world.

“Thank you Uncle He.” Yang Kai’s voice had a slight trembling to it.

The Boss smiled and looked up, “When living alone, don’t you have household problems? In the future, whenever you’re hungry just come to our shop, we may not have much, but we still have enough rice for you to eat.”

“Okay.” Yang Kai nodded his head, this world still had good people around.

Shortly, two enthusiastic people came to the rice store and kicked some people who were ready to order their meals from the line and away from the store front.

“Ahhhh.....” the second Little Brother fell, landed on his butt, and flipped over. It was a big problem because after he fell to the ground he couldn’t get up again.

“Why?” Boss He called towards the people who had kicked the little brother as he ran out from behind the counter and towards the two men. Kai Yang quickly helped second little brother up whilst intently glaring at the two evil faced men. One of the men, looked pale and thin, was clutching his stomach, while the other one was built like a bear, supported the pale one. These two were the ones who kicked the second brother.

“Who’s the boss here?” The man people shouted out.

“I am, I am.” Boss He quickly replied. He was only an ordinary merchant, yet the two men who called him out had such fierce looking faces. The swords at their waist and the fierce faces that showed they were not easily trifled with. Boss He wondered what had happened.

“Well, well. So you are the black-hearted boss. You even dared to sell poisonous rice to my brother. Look at him! Originally he was a strong man, but after eating your rice he became this sickly. Normally he is as strong as a bear, but he can hardly stand now! You black-hearted person, worrying only about money and going as far as to take lives!”

At this outburst from the man, Boss He worriedly stammered out: “Ah, how could this be? How could it?”

The man then said: “How would I know? This morning my brother bought some rice from you, and made rice porridge, then he became like this after eating the rice he bought from you. I was lucky I didn’t eat any, otherwise I also would’ve become like him.”

Boss He’s forehead began to sweat, he took his sleeves and kept wiping his forehead and said “Respected customer, I fear there might be a misunderstanding.”

“Misunderstanding? Misunderstanding your mother! If it wasn’t your rice, then what caused him to become like this?” The Han man roared.

(TLN: Han people were a type of ethnic inside of China)

Kai Yang sat down and pondered the situation while all eyes were on the commotion. Boss He is such a nice person, Kai Yang couldn’t believe that this person who gave him rice, would put poison in it. Not to mention the fact Boss He couldn’t possibly have a black heart in Kai Yang’s mind, a black-hearted businessman wouldn’t be so stupid as to poison his own rice.

If these information spread how would he do business in the future? Who would dare come and buy his rice?

The two men’s poor excuses were really unbearable, and they couldn’t even consider a that it was something else.

Therefore, these two are definitely here to ruin others. But this move was a bit too evil, for they implied that the Boss needed someone to die just to earn some money.

Even though Kai Yang’s body was weak he was still a practitioner. And through these past years he had seen countless types of people, so he felt he could accurately judge Boss He. The man was also someone who he owed greatly and when Kai Yang witnessed this, it caused his face to fall. He stood up and said: “These two......”

“What?” One of the men threw him a glare, his anger evident.

Kai Yang didn’t speak, but Boss He immediately sprang in front of him. He slowly shook his head for Kai Yang to stop.

(TL: *Tear* Boss He, you’re too kind.)

“Uncle He.....” Kai Yang was stunned.

“Even in bankruptcy, avoid misfortunes!” Boss He whispered.

Kai Yang just helplessly sighed. That fact that the boss said this, signalled that he knew what the two Han men were on about. But in order to do business, one must have a good name. The earlier commotion had already attracted a lot of attention, if this continued, then the rice stand’s reputation would go down the drain.

Even if one knew what they said was false, one could only comply with them and hurriedly hope to end this fiasco before too much damage was done.

In desperation, Boss He faced the man: “Regarding your brother’s illness, I can say that it has nothing to do with me......”

After the two men heard this, one cried out in anger: “Even if it’s not related, I have already come to this rice stand. If I don’t make the truth clear, then my brother’s suffering would be in vain. He should be sent to the doctor immediately! But of course, if you are willing to shoulder the medical bills, then we are willing to drop the subject.”

After this statement it was clear the that you really needed to go bankrupt to avoid misfortunes. If people really wanted to extort money, they would do it over a period of time. The demands that these two men were making were too short sighted, if Boss He agreed to pay them off now his rice stands reputation would still suffer. For nothing is watertight and news of him selling poisoned rice would spread. This told Kai Yang that the men were either not interested in extorting Boss He for more money or that they had some other goal.

Who would have imagined that these two Han men had not intention of compromising: “You black hearted boss. Who do think we two brothers are, to be exploited by you so freely? We two brothers were really unlucky to have bought poisoned rice from you! Where is your guilty conscience?”

That statement resonated quite deeply with Kai Yang. He curled his lip while sitting, thinking were they virtuous and living life a clear conscience?

Boss He was also stupefied. What? Weren’t these two men here to extort money?

While stunned and unsure what to do, more and more people had started to gather. A handsome boy similar to Kai Yang’s age had also appeared. From his looks, he was clearly far better off than Kai Yang.

That young man casually walked up to the men, and circled them with interest. Whilst doing so he constantly clicked his tongue.

Others may have not noticed, but with a glance Kai Yang recognised those three as the people he spotted earlier in the alley.

The crowd just stared at the boy, who had just appeared!

Weren’t these three men together? Kai Yang sensed an evil plot in the air.

Suddenly the Sky Tower disciple walked out to the crowd and circled around. His expression slowly turned to one of mockery and arrogance.

But the two Han men were not easily mocked and creased their faces: “You little brat, walking around in circles has made this uncle dizzy. Do you want be the same?”

The youngster just snickered. Standing in front of the two men, watching the ‘poisoned’ man he said: “Your face is very pale. Looks like your poisoning isn’t simple.”

“Of course it’s not.” He viciously responded: “If it were not, why would I be here and with my brother, instead of at the doctor’s. We’re here to reveal this boss’ black’ heart and his true colours. Hoping that no one will buy from his store again and suffer as we have.”

This made Boss He’s face pale, for he didn’t know what the aim of these two men was. If it were extorting money then he would understand, but their motives were very puzzling and unclear.

Just when he was pondering this, Kai Yang softly inquired: “Uncle He, did you offend anybody during this time?”

Thinking hard, Boss He miserably wailed: “No one.”

“Then could it be that your rice shop prevented someone from earning money?” Even though Kai Yang was young, he had experienced many things. So this thought was not impossible.

“This is just a humble job to survive, how could I prevent others from their income?”

Now this was weird! Staring at the ground, Kai Yang thought hard, but was still confused.

Then, the Sky Tower disciple sneered and asked the two men a question. They shouted out: “Look, trickery!”

While shouting, the man resorted to a trick, to open the black heart of the poisonous apple.

(TLN: Saying for showing true colours)

This surprised people around, for the morning had been quite sluggish. The Han man was wildly hopping about, while his fists were clenched. Jumping, he went to expose the poisonous truth.

Moving like this, his once pale face became flushed and rosy.

This caused to crowd to gasp. Clearly they were shocked over this sudden change.

“Poisoned.” Looking that the two Han men, he sarcastically said: “Such skill. I respect them, respect.”

The two men couldn’t help but pale. Not only did the fallen man not turn white, he also looked like he wasn’t poisoned.

The surrounding people also started to boo. They weren’t stupid, how could they not be able to understand the situation? They didn’t know what motives these men had, but to slander Boss He’s Rice Stand was shameful. Luckily, that Sky Tower disciple had uncovered the truth.

More and more people had started to despise the men and started to praise that young man. This young man was naturally easy to like and with this incident, his reputation sky-rocketed.

While Kai Yang secretly confirmed his suspicions that they were all acting. They were acting out the play of a honourable knight uncovering foul play and protecting the weak, in order to gain reputation! If he hadn’t seen them together earlier in the alley, he was afraid he would have also believed them.

But why did they go to all that effort?

The two Han men could no longer keep up the accusations. Staring fiercely at the young man they asked: “Brat, who are you to interfere in my brother’s issues!”

Gracefully he turned around and arrogantly replied: “I am Sky Tower’s Su Mu!”

Hearing those words, one of the men became afraid: “No wonder, you are a Sky Tower disciple. A dragon within here. Today these two brothers have admitted defeat. If fate allows it, I hope we will meet again!”

This sentence felt like it was planned beforehand, making Kai Yang Laugh.

Su Mu just laughed coldly: “Leave safely, for I won’t escort you!”

With the situation like this, and if it were indeed no accident like Kai Yang suspected. Then the two men would leave and ‘Su Mu’ would then seek out the audience’s praise. Especially Boss He’s.

But Kai Yang didn’t want Boss He to be fooled. Before those two men left, he quickly said: “You can’t let them go, they are too despicable. Today’s victim was He’s Rice Stand, but if we don’t teach them a lesson, they may target Liu Shi’s Clothes shop or Jiang Shi’s Grocery.”

Most of people who heard this, couldn’t help but notice that what he said was correct. How could they let these despicable villains leave so easily? If they let them go today then tomorrow they might target another shop and leave them destroyed. If it came to that, then they may not be as lucky as Boss He.

Thinking of this, the people started to block off the path in front of the two Han men.

From his position, Kai Yang could clearly see the panic in Su Mu’s eyes. This in turn, lead Su Mu to source of the voice, to Kai Yang. While the two men exchanged glances and quickly readjusted their expressions.

Chuckling, Kai Yang added: “Fellow disciple, there is a saying that goes; Good people follow through to the end. Just like how Buddha went to the west, why don’t you and I both arrest these two criminals?”

(TLN: Saying that he should finish his job. Also the Buddha reference is to this. You guys should try it, Chinese folklore.)

Seeing Kai Yang’s thin and fragile physique, Su Mu couldn’t help but burst out in annoyance: “Who’s your fellow disciple?”

Kai Yang Replied: “I am also a Sky Tower disciple. I entered the Main Gate three years ago.”

This made Su Mu speechless, for he really was a fellow disciple.

“Now, without further ado.” Kai Yang came forward and said: “Throughout the land, it is important to be reasonable. While one must also be chivalrous, so brother you must not let only me take the benefit. Let both of us arrest these two cowardly men and help Boss He claim justice, while also helping Black Plum Village. ”

With this statement, the surrounding people began to applaud. This filled Su Mu with anxiety, for he felt as if he was dragged upon a pirate’s ship by this unknown brother. Even he wanted to escape, he couldn’t.

Those two men were also glancing continuously at Su Mu looking for guidance/help/assistance. Looking at them, Su Mu couldn’t do anything for them.

“Brother, let’s go!” Pulling on Su Mu’s shoulder, Kai Yang rushed over.

What is this! Su Mu was in tears, wondering where did this brother come from. This really ruined my plans! But it had already come to this point, so Su Mu could only charge over. While he was preparing to capture them, he was also signalling for them to look for a opportunity to escape.

The two men nodded, but Kai Yang saw the exchange and guessed what they were doing.

He was worried that Boss He would be tricked, so he took extra precaution and shouted: “Friends, fellow owners, don’t just watch. Come help us two brothers!”

Hearing this, Boss He also went to help. The rice stand’s youngsters joined in, their hands carrying empty rag bags. Boss He was previously abused by these two men, so naturally they would want revenge.

Seeing that Boss He had acted, the crowd couldn’t just watch and they all flocked towards the two men to capture them.

Previously the two men weren’t worried, but as they saw this scene, their faces paled. So they quickly yelled: “Don’t hit the face!” While protecting their face, they curled up on the ground.

(TL: Tsk, tsk. You’re men, and you say “Don’t hit the face!”, appalling.

ED: That’s their money maker. How will they make it as actors if they are beaten up. no mercy from you.)

Bang, bang, bang, bang, the sound of the beating rang out. Even though the businesses on this street were run by ordinary people, they currently displayed a powerful fighting spirit that left others flabbergasted. These merchants, more or less did anything for money and were generally detested by others. And now, when they were given to chance to release their stress, how could they be lenient?

This was especially true for He’s Rice Stand’s waiter. With rag bags in his hands, he relentlessly beat down on the men.

Furthermore, with so many people hitting these men, they couldn’t identify who was hitting them. So these people didn’t have to worry about the consequences.

There is strength in numbers. Kai Yang only asked for aid, but before he could lift a finger, he was pushed aside by these merchants.

After a while, the beating gradually stopped and you could see the two men curled on the ground bruised all over. The rag bag had also disappeared. Looking at the men, Su Mu’s heart cried out in pain, and his leg started to cramp. For the men were beaten bloody and their faces so swollen, that even theirs mothers won’t be able to recognise them.

(ED: No mercy on their faces, crowd has the same attitude as you, so harsh

TL: Geez, just saying.)

This situation only occurred because the men didn’t have enough strength to protect themselves. Although they had swords, one could see that it was only for decoration. If they could use them would they suffer these attacks?

Though on the other hand, how could experts stoop so low as to perform such despicable acts?

Now, even though the beating was finished the merchants remained.

The two Han men with their horrendous faces, and hearts full of fear weakly called: “Su....” Their hands trembling.

Unfortunately, Su Mu’s expression changed and he loudly exclaimed: “What su, you want this young master to give you *pasty bones?”

(TLN: *Because his name is Su, a play a words with his name’s meaning)

Seeing this, Kai Yang smiled and proclaimed: “You two scumbags! I don’t know have many others you have framed, but it’s extremely hateful!”

His words words are an exaggeration, but for the merchants present, this seemed like the truth. That waiter who previously held the rag bag spat: “Pei, you trashes. You actually dared to act arrogantly at this rice stand.”

The waiter continued to let out his frustrations, but didn’t expect Kai Yang to expand on his statement: “Correct. These types of people should really die. Fellow disciple, why don’t you and I each kill one. That will teach them to break the law again and also be for the greater good.”

Hearing this remark, the two people on the floor started to break out in cold sweat and were terrified. They had never expected this frail boy to be so ruthless.

Su Mu just stared at him, trying to figure out whether or not he was joking. But Kai Yang’s face held no sign that it was a joke.

To tell the truth, although what the men did was cowardly, it wasn’t serious enough to die for. Undoubtedly Kai Yang’s punishment was a little too cruel.

Su Mu could only ask: “Brother, isn’t that a bit excessive? Right?”

“Excessive?” Kai Yang just shook his head: “If their little lie were to succeed today, then Boss He’s life would have been ruined. How would he maintain a livelihood? This is pushing people to the limits, so how is this excessive? You know, for every person, every action that they do, will have a consequence.”

Previously, when those merchant heard Kai Yang’s words, they had also thought this. But hearing his reasoning, they understood the sense behind his words and were conflicted. But the final decision wasn’t up to them, so they just stood on the sidelines. But when Boss He wanted to say something, he was stopped by a look from Kai Yang.

“This.....this may certainly be the case, but we can’t just casually go killing people.” Now Su Mu was really worried. He didn’t think that this disciple in front of him was so ruthless and merciless. Originally he had planned it out quite well; Firstly, those two men would go slander Boss He and then he would go and stop them, saving Boss He. Then they would escape and he would receive gratitude from the Boss thus accomplishing his goal. But he hadn’t thought that such a vicious disciple would appear, so easily choosing to kill them.

This was far from good.

Su Mu could see that the two men were pleading him to save them. Within those gazes, were signs of threats. How could Su Mu not understand their meaning?

It was like being tied to the body of a grasshopper. If we are to suffer a tragic end, then you would not come out unharmed. That was their meaning..

At that moment, Kai Yang said: “Brother, there is no other method. Through my experiences, killing is a natural thing. Could it be that you haven’t killed before? Or you guys already know each other.......so you are unwilling to kill?”

This statement made Su Mu’s heart jump to his throat. Turning around to look at Kai Yang, he found a mischievous smile.

“Brother what do you mean?” With a cool face he questioned, while thinking whether or not Kai Yang saw through him. He hadn’t revealed any clues, so how could he know?

What he didn’t know, was that Kai Yang knew of his plan purely by coincidence. If not he would had also been fooled.

Boss He was also smart, he understood the hidden meaning in Kai Yang’s words and asked Su Mu: “Little brother, what tune are you singing?”

(TLN: Chinese phrasing of what are you up to/planning.)

Kai Yang had revealed a portion of Su Mu’s true colours, how could Boss He not be able to see?

Kai Yang just shook his head, he didn’t point out anything in particular but just continued to stare at Su Mu: “Brother, I think that you are a courageous person, but you are hesitating. Don’t worry, I am here to accompany you and the villagers too. So what are you afraid of?”

“What am I afraid of?” Su Mu laughed out loud, as if reassuring himself, he said: “What am I afraid of? Isn’t it just killing a person? Who hasn’t killed before?”

It was like he was unwillingly to admit he hadn’t killed before, in front of Kai Yang.

In the end, this person’s disposition shocked him. Su Mu hadn’t stepped down from the challenge.

Su Mu then directed a cold, ruthless intent towards the men lying on the ground. Looking into that young man’s eyes, those two men knew they were finished. This round, they were used too thoroughly.

“Brother, let’s do it.” Kai Yang continued to pour oil on the flame.

Breathing deeply, Su Mu slowly nodded.

Seeing this happen, the two men immediately knew their end was nigh. So how could they endure without doing anything? Jumping up, they pointed towards Su Mu and proclaimed: “Su Mu, you treacherous bastard. You asked us brothers for a favour, to slander Boss He’s stand so that you could come to the rescue and become a hero. But how do you repay us? Not only are we beaten like pigs, now we have to die for your crimes. You really are trash.”

“You lie!” Hearing his scheme revealed, Su Mu was furious.

“Hmph!” As if their injuries didn’t affect them, the men just sneered and the larger man shouted out loudly, informing all: “Everybody, young or old, today my brother and I came out and caused trouble for you. But this was all at the command of Su Mu. He had taken fancy to Boss He’s daughter, but sadly she rejected him. So he hatched a plan to obtain her.”

When this was revealed, something clicked inside the heads of the onlookers. Many people could not help but turn to look at Su Mu with disbelief in their eyes.

So that was it! Kai Yang was satisfied that he had guessed correctly, Su Mu really had an ulterior motive. Though he had thought it was something related to profit or reputation. He hadn’t thought it was actually for his own sexual desires.

He had also met the Boss’ daughter, even though she wasn’t outrageously beautiful, she was still a work of art. Alluring body, delicate features, slim figure and the most beautiful girl in the entire village at only fourteen.

Such a young girl, unfortunately had caught Su Mu’s eye, provoking such trouble.

“What utter rubbish!” Su Mu’s face was as red as a tomato, trying to deny the truth.

Sneering the man continued to say: “I have said no lies. Even though us two brothers have our faults, and do some criminal acts,slandering Boss He and poisoning his rice this we would never do. Fellow people, you should know that sabotaging others’ livelihoods, is equal to sabotaging my own. So how can I survive? Everything was instigated by this little brat.”

This statement was very sincere, causing everybody to start laughing.

In a timely manner Kai Yang asked: “After this was over how much did he promise to give?”

“Fifty two silvers!” The man replied.

“Fifty two, that’s a lot.” Kai Yang softly said while nodding.

During this banter, Boss He was listening carefully. This made him understand the situation thoroughly, turning towards Su Mu he angrily said: “You despicable person. You actually dared to to use such dirty methods to get my daughter. Thankfully she has eyes and saw your true face. Ah, how could Sky Tower have such a degenerate disciple. You are ruining your school’s good name. You are vain and selfish, with a character completely opposite to brother Yang. I feel ashamed for your mother and father.”

Surrounding merchants also started to feel more contempt towards Su Mu’s outrageous acts.

Su Mu’s face was bright red, for he knew that he could no longer come back to Black Plum Village. For his mask had been taken away and his true face revealed.

And the source of all his misfortunes was in front of him............this disciple! If not for him, he would have been able to win the boss’ favour and further his reputation. That would have made it easier to curry the daughter’s love for him.

But all that planning had gone to waste. Not only had he failed to gain any reputation, he had also lost reputation he had previously for being a disciple of Sky Tower.

Under that situation, Su Mu put on a calm face and turned towards Kai Yang and asked: “Brother, how may I call you?”

“You guess!” Kai Yang replied with a wink.

Taking a deep breath Su Mu said: “Though you may chose to withhold your identity, I will able able to find out. For you have already entered the school for three years, yet you are not a official disciple. That means you are a Trial Disciple and within the entire school, there are only a few of you. Finding you will be simple.”

When he finished he immediately turned around and left. In the end, he did have some strength. For those who blocked his path, he pushed them to the side. Waltzing away unhindered

When he had left, the people had only just remembered the two Han men. But where were they? There was no trace, for when Kai Yang and Su Mu were arguing, they had sneakily ran away.

The debacle had finally been resolved. Kai Yang was satisfied, for he had exposed the deceit, gained approval from the merchants and Boss He was especially grateful to him.

That waiter also looked at Kai Yang in worship.

After the crowd dispersed, the Boss’ wife also came out. Taking Kai Yang’s hand, the more she looked, the more she came to like him.

On the contrary, Boss He’s he was full of worry: “Virtuous nephew Yang, today you have offended Su Mu. I’m afraid that in the future, this will cause you ceaseless trouble.”

After this incident, Boss He’s started to refer to Kai Yang more intimately.

“Afraid?.” Kai Yang just smiled. “The Main Gate has its own rules, so even if he hates me to death he can’t do anything.”

“Even so, you must be careful nephew. If because of your involvement in this matter you were to suffer misfortune then I as your Uncle would worry greatly.

“I will be careful.” He consoled.

Kai Yang was immensely grateful to the He couple for extending a helping hand. They even insisted he stay for dinner, originally Kai Yang wanted to, but was scared away by the boss’ wife.

“Little Yang, where are you parents? Where do you live? Have you married already?”

Looking at this, clearly the boss’ wife wanted to become his mother-in-law. Knowing this, Kai Yang hurriedly left.

When he left, he was carrying a bag of white rice, but it far surpassed the amount 20 silvers could get you. So for an entire month, Kai Yang didn’t have to worry amount his meals.

Originally, Kai Yang was worried that Su Mu would ambush him on his way back. For as innocent as Su Mu looked, he was a sinister and treacherous snake on the inside, this was not impossible. Though, even when Kai Yang returned, Su Mu hadn’t appeared.

He thought about it carefully, not attacking was the correct choice. Even though duels between disciples often resulted in death, the Main Gate didn’t allow the needless killing of others. In short, if Su Mu had attacked on his way back to the school, then when things leaked out, it would have resulted in his own doom too.

If he wanted to deal with Kai Yang, then he would definitely come to challenge him, while making a fuss too. As for the matter of Kai Yang’s identity, there is no doubt that he would be able to find it. In the Sky Tower, as long as Su Mu inquired a bit, then naturally he would find his identity.

Su Mu’s true strength, Kai Yang didn’t fully see, but he most definitely was at the peak of the tempered body. The only thing was he didn’t know what stage exactly.

Seems like he must focus more on his practises. Otherwise, Kai Yang truly couldn’t continue staying at Sky Tower.

Knowing this, Kai Yang swiftly returned back to his hut to practise.

At this hour, he was unable to practise the Tempered Body Record, but he could practise the basic skills that the school gave. These basic skills were to establish the foundations for the tempered body, to achieve spiritual consumption beyond his own body. This was the aim.

(TLN: It’s talking about things like qi/ki/spiritual energy)

Kai Yang’s previous usage of the Shaolin arts and the leg whip were all based around his foundation work. If not for this, then the skills couldn’t be considered true martial arts. They would only be considered as the basic of basic skills, essential for all schools and families.

To the left of Kai Yang’s hut, there a wooden figure. This was made, from a century old tree, by Kai Yang to practise on. Small dents were littered over it, there were even traces of blood. These were all made through Kai Yang’s many days of diligent training.

Assuming his position, Kai Yang started to hit the wooden man. He infused all his might into each strike, beating the wooden man relentlessly. Peng, peng rang out as he struck the wooden man. However, after a few strikes, he felt that something was amiss.

It was his own fists and leg so he clearly felt that they were stronger than before. From the strike and the sound it made, all of them were stronger and more stable, incomparable to before. And over time, his hand and the bones started to feel numb and warm. This clearly indicated that he was stimulating his meridians, increasing his atmospheric affinity.

Reaching the tempered body fourth stage, gives birth to the atmospheric affinity, developing your meridians further and allowing you to sense the energy more clearly. This warm feeling was Kai Yang’s meridians developing.

Kai Yang practised until the sun set, only then did he stop. Even after this period of time, not only was he not fatigued, he even felt more alive. Ever since he merged with that golden skeleton his strength seemed to skyrocket. Walking twenty miles today didn’t even tire him out, even with the added weight of the sack of rice he hadn’t become fatigued.

It was only when he was cultivating his tempered body, that he would truly feel pressured. Thinking about that morning’s practise, Kai Yang couldn’t help but shudder. That pressure was like the heaven and earth were crushing him, horrifying.

But with strain/pressure come development. Without extreme pressure, how could you possibly advance.

Only then, would a person’s true potential show. And only then would your strength grow, step by step, each time breaking past your limits.

Though currently, even after throwing large amounts of punches and kicks out, Kai Yang has yet to feel any fatigue. He doesn’t feel strained, how can he force out his potential and improve?

This made things difficult and made him depressed. That skeleton also gave him extreme recovery, making the basic skills of the school useless. Did that mean that he could only practise for half an hour each day at sunrise?

Daylight had around twelve full hours, and yet he could only practise for half an hour. What would he do the rest of the time? Sleep? This was obviously impossible, Kai Yang immediately rejected the idea.

(TL: wow getting stronger by only practising 30 mins each day while sleeping the rest? lucky.

ED: so glad he’s not following in the footsteps of contribution Hall Uncle)

While he absentmindedly cooked, Kai Yang thought about how he should train to exhaustion. If anyone else knew of this, they would have laughed to death.

Other practitioners may have wanted to take it easier, but Kai Yang wanted to push himself to the limit.

In the end, he still couldn’t think of any good methods. Though the main reason was Kai Yang needed elixirs to help boost his training. There were also other methods, but in the end, all of these had one thing in common, they required—- money.

In Sky Tower, contribution points were the currency. Alas, Kai Yang was poor and only had a measly twelve points.

After the rice finished cooking, he wolfed down a few bowls. Although there were no sides dishes, and he could only eat plain rice, Kai Yang was very satisfied. That was the only meal in the past few days, which made him full.

After dinner, he couldn’t go train, so he went to take a bath. After that he lay down and went to bed. Continuing his practise, there would be no result, so he might as well try to solve that problem. Consider the solutions, to hasten the work speed.

After thinking for awhile, he suddenly remembered; the black book.

One of the pages had something inside, so Kai Yang figured that the other pages would be the same. So if he had enough strength, he could unseal each page.

The first page contained the Golden Skeleton, which was also the cause of his current predicament.

While the second dealt with the methods to cultivate the tempered body with Golden skeleton.

However the third page remained blank. He had already tried to decipher it, but Kai Yang concluded he wasn’t strong enough yet.

With the first and second pages unlocked, Kai Yang could start to study them. But after good half day he still couldn’t figure them out. Until he accidentally turned to the third page and went into a trance.

Eh? Kai Yang frowned as he started to read the third page.

Almost instantly, countless gold words started to appear on the page and jumped into his mind. Then a small whirlpool started to appear in the center of the page. From it, arose an antique incense burner.

This turn of events left Kai Yang in shock, but quickly he started to rejoice.

Ah right, didn’t he break through into the fourth stage this morning? Last night he was still in the third stage, but today he’s in the fourth. So that’s why he couldn’t access the third page before?

Although it was only one level, it had still hindered his ability to comprehend the third page.

After he thought about this, Kai Yang couldn’t help but feel regret. If this morning he had discovered this, then he wouldn’t need to waste time now thinking about it.

Calming his beating heart, Kai Yang held the incense burner and carefully inspected it.

This burner wasn’t large in size, and was a common item used by people. But it was half sealed, with a lid on the mouth and a few holes. It was also antique and of outstanding quality, but it wasn’t attention grabbing at all.

Gently he sniffed, but there was no odor and slowly he lowered it.

What is it made of? Even after a while, Kai Yang still didn’t know but could only go on the information imprinted in his mind.

After a short pause, Kai Yang opened his eyes with a strange look in them.

According to the information in his mind, this incense burner could aid him during training. The burner itself has no special properties, however if you were to gather herbs and burn them in it, the fragrance released would aid you during training.

Different herbs were needed for different stages.

Unfortunately, Kai Yang had some doubts. The plants needed to aid him at his current level were the Three Leaved Destruction/Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass.

According to his understanding, the value of these two herbs were not high but they were very hard to find. They also possessed small amounts of toxins. Inhaled over a short period of time these toxins would do no lasting damage, but over many years the accumulation in your body would really injure you.

Would these two herbs really be effective in helping him?

These herbs were definitely available in the Contribution Hall, but with Old Man Meng’s personality, he would definitely charge high prices for them. And with only a few points in his possession, how could he spend them like that?

There was only one option left. He would have to venture into the Black Wind Mountains to look for them himself. Kai Yang had already hunted in there before, so was quite familiar with its geography and perhaps the herbs were there.

Tomorrow into the mountains he shall go! With his problems currently solved, Kai Yang slowly drifted to sleep. But before he fell asleep, he checked the fourth page so as to not repeat this morning’s embarrassing action. Unfortunately nothing appeared, it seemed that Tempered Body Fourth Stage was not sufficient for this page.

The next morning, Kai Yang got up early.

Yesterday’s practise had already had such a large impact on his cultivation, so naturally he would make full use of the short time he had to cultivate. Not to mention, he was not a lazy person.

While immersing himself in the purple eastern air/gas, that slow but with the might of heaven and earth infused, Tempered Body Record fist’s might gradually unfolded.

While he was a stage stronger than yesterday, Kai Yang still didn’t make much progress on the fist. You could only perform it twenty times and when he touched his back, torturous pain responded. His back, hip and bones all ached, they felt like smashed beans.

Inhaling a mouthful of purple gas, his bodily senses as energy became clearer. His meridians all opened up and began to expel the impurities in his body.

With his daily training finished, he started his sweeping, which since absorbing the golden skeleton he had been able to complete in only one hour. After he finished sweeping he ran to the Contribution Hall.

Although Kai Yang had decided to go into the mountains to find the herbs, he had no knowledge regarding herbology. He had only heard of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, and didn’t know what they looked like.

Most of his preparatory work for his journey into the Black Wind Mountain was done. To avoid an embarrassing situation, Kai Yang hurried to the Contribution Hall to write down the herbs’ appearance.

Originally he had planned to ask Treasurer Meng to teach him, he hadn’t expected Treasurer Meng to give him a book on herbs instead.

Looking at the book, Kai Yang found that it had an introduction to herbs and their medical properties, habitats and illustrations. Though it would give create a feeling of disappointment in those who read it. As it merely contained information on ordinary grade herbs and nothing on the herbs of a higher grade, but it was quite suitable for Kai Yang’s current needs.

Just as practitioners were classified into different ranks, so to were herbs, weapons and medicinal pellets. They were divided into, Ordinary Grade, Earth Grade, Heaven Grade, Mystery Grade, Spirit Grade and Saint Grade. Each of the Grades were then divided into the lower, middle and peak level.

Luckily the herbs that Kai Yang needed were both Ordinary Grade, Lower class herbs so they were in the book. And since they were such a low grade, their value wasn’t high.

After he left the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang went to the General Affairs Office. Afterall he was still a sweeper of Sky Tower’s and this roundabout journey to Black Wind Mountain would take more than a day. So he had to ask to be excused from his work.

The General Affairs Office didn’t make things difficult for him. They gave Kai Yang three days of leave, with his obligations taken care of he set off...

Black Wind Mountain was only twenty miles away from Sky Tower by foot. Since it wasn’t that far, Kai Yang frequently went there to hunt for his meals, making him quite familiar with the terrain.

In this mountain was a vast and diverse range of herbs. But since it was his first time collecting herbs, Kai Yang made sure to be fully prepared. Carrying his water, food supplies, a shovel and a bag, he hit the road.

Rushing over, Kai Yang came to Black Wind Mountain and surveyed the area. The Mountain was like a prehistoric monster, lying down between the heavens and the earth. Imposing, with no end in sight, the mountain with its lush forests, jagged edges proudly stood against the horizon. Standing there, Kai Yang felt a cool breeze blow through his hair.

Within Black Wind Mountain lived many ferocious beasts. Some high levelled ferocious beasts could even make martial practitioners flee with no chance of victory. So generally when people ventured into the mountain, they wouldn’t go too deep. The first thirty or so miles were classified as the safe zone, the next ten miles were the dangerous zone. And the area beyond that, was the life-threatening zone. Basically the deeper you went, the more dangerous it was.

Since Kai Yang was only looking for ordinary grade lower level herbs he didn’t need to venture too far in. So naturally he didn’t have to worry about his safety as he would only be searching within the safe zone.

Currently it was still in the early hours of the morning and Kai Yang was trying to recall whether or not he had stumbled upon those herbs in his previous trips to the mountain. But it didn’t matter whether he had or not, as he was prepared this time to find them equipped with the knowledge from the book.

Thinking back, Kai Yang remembered that there were many potential places for herbs to grow in. In his current situation he didn’t even know the locations of the herbs he wanted to find.

But filled with anticipation, Kai Yang followed the familiar track into Black Wind Mountain.

After half an hour Kai Yang spotted his first harvest hidden within the thicket next to the track he, was a bunch of Li Chi/Sharp Teeth herbs. Harvesting them, Kai Yang put them into his bag and continued his search, thinking to himself this was a good start. Walking down the road, Kai Yang looked at the various vegetation scattered about, and memories of the forest came flooding back, informing him of his location. With his knowledge of the Mountain, gained from hunting, he could accurately create a mental map of where he was in relation to Sky Tower, preventing him from getting lost. By evening Kai Yang had collected four different types of herbs.

When searching for herbs it is naturally very hard,not to mention that many people like to come here to collect herbs, making it even harder to find them. Although Kai Yang only found four herbs, he was still pretty satisfied.

Unfortunately Kai Yang didn’t need these four herbs, to make matters worse their grades were only at Ordinary Grade, lower level too. Nevertheless if he were to take them back, he could exchange them for contribution points, so they were of some value.

At this time the sun had already started to set. Hurrying, Kai Yang finally arrived at an area which was suitable for the growth of many herbs.

This area was very strange, for all its bountiful vegetation it was devoid of any living presence. Especially for an area of thirty feet around around the area of herbs the land was completely dead and nothing grew, not even weeds.

Though in the center of the this wasteland, there were three bunches of grass. They fluttered in the wind, Kai Yang saw that they were brown coloured, and thought that is was just necrosis. But this was just the grass’ natural colour.

After looking at it in more detail Kai Yang recognised them as a type of herb and with a sigh of relief, rushed over. Smiling widely, he quickly dug them all up.

A little while later, these three herbs were collected.

As he held these herbs, Kai Yang took out the herbology book that Treasurer Meng gave him earlier and checked it to see where he had seen them before. They were indeed the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. The illustrations, growth and environment all matched up.

Dead Jedi Tree Grass grew from dead trees, which made it quite easy to find. Basically in the mountains, any place that had dead land, you could find it growing nearby.

Carefully, Kai Yang placed the grass in his bag and took out some water and food, then took out his water and food and looked for a place to eat and rest.

This time when he entered the mountains his main goal was to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, now that he had found the Dead Jedi Tree Grass he need to switch his focus to the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. Not only did he need to find the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower but he also needed a large quantity of it.. Kai Yang decided he must double his efforts.

Though right now, it was already evening and the sun had set. This was naturally an inconvenient time to search for herbs so Kai Yang decided to find a spot to rest and continue tomorrow.

Previously when he entered/forayed into the mountains, he had never stayed overnight, however as the saying goes “Even if you hadn’t tasted pork, you have at least seen a pig before”. On that note, he naturally knew the dangers of the mountains at night.

(TLN: I think it’s pretty self-explanatory. But for those who are confused, it means that even if you haven’t experienced some things, you should have some knowledge of them.) Man even got to edit the comments, no rest for the wicked

After he found the nearest tree, Kai Yang climbed up and looked for a suitable place to sleep, after locating a place he immediately laid down and closed his eyes.

(ED: Trees are so hard to locate in a forest on a mountain)

By one-thirty am, Kai Yang had yet to fall asleep, so he took out the black book and turned to page three. With a thought, the incense burner floated out.

This was also a little mystery that Kai Yang had solved about the black book. Anything that was stored inside could be called out and returned at will. It was afterall a storage book, and the burner had obviously been placed in there before so this function didn’t come as a complete surprise.

(TL: Our MC isn’t very bright. It’s a storage book, if you could take things out, why couldn’t they be put back in? How did the burner end up in it in the first place? A mystery........ಠ_ಠ)

What Kai Yang didn’t understand was that apart from the incense burner, other things could not be stored in the book. This made him wonder, was the black book a soul stone? Do soul stones normally have restrictions on what to accept and reject?

After playing with the black book for a while, Kai Yang fell asleep. He had just spent the entire day walking around the mountain after all.

After a peaceful night, Kai Yang got up early the next morning and practised the tempered body record for half an hour. In order to gather a good harvest, he must work very hard for the next two days. He also felt that he was on the brink of a breakthrough, not only did he feel that his atmospheric sense was at the utmost limit, he also felt his body was as well. Kai Yang just needed a final push in order to breakthrough.

The discovery that he was near a breakthrough left Kai Yang ecstatic. For it took him three years to make it to the tempered body third stage. But on the second day of obtaining this book, he had broken through and now once again he will break through again. This training speed also made Kai Yang somewhat scared.

Practising the tempered body record consumed a large amount of stamina. So Kai Yang rested afterwards and slowly regained his stamina . After he had regained his stamina he ate some of the remain food and continued his search for the herbs.

Yesterday he had travelled to all the places from his memory that could potentially grow his required herbs. Today he would have to rely on luck. Fortunately, the value of these herbs were not high, so the chance of finding them today was still high.

(TL: Trust me Kai Yang, luck is the only thing you don’t need to worry about.)

After an entire day of searching, Kai Yang had found a total of seventy eight herbs and two Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. This time he had finally found the herbs he required to activate the incense burner, but the quantity he had was still lacking.

Time passed by, and soon darkness came. Kai Yang was still awake though, it was not because he wasn’t tired but rather that he was too hungry to fall asleep.

(（＊〇□〇）......! & (O.O) )

Originally he had planned to hunt some wild game, but had not even seen a single rabbit. Unfortunately he could only find some fingernail-sized berries which were very sour. When he finished eating them it only made him feel even more hungry.

Ah! If I knew that this was going to happen, I would have brought more rice balls! Kai Yang repented. There is no shop in these desolate areas, where is he going to find food?

This hunger was a real embarrassment. Kai Yang then saw in the distance, a hint of a fire. Instantly his energy came back, picking himself up he walked towards it.

They dared to light a fire in a forest; these people were either idiots or they had nothing to fear. This time, these people belonged to the latter.

When he approached, a person near the fire thundered: “Who!”

(TL & ED: T^T, Kai Yang you’re finally going to make some friends)

At that moment, Kai Yang felt his muscles tighten and his spine shiver. The two people by the fire were vigilant. One was tall and the other was short.

One had a burly physique and held a bow with an arrow notched he pointed the arrow at Kai Yang. The other was a young boy, aged about eleven and his eyes were bright and held no trace of fear. In this boy’s hand was also a bow, and he also had notched an arrow back, but it was much smaller.

(TL: Maybe not........

ED: How can you doubt our MC, have some faith)

Although Kai Yang was faced with the two arrows, he didn’t have the slightest intention to retaliate. Walking around, he acted as if their threats were nothing big.

“Take it easy. I only entered the mountain to collect herbs.” Kai Yang quickly said.

After they heard this, the two people looked at each other. The burly (I really want to say buff) slowly lowered his bow and arrow down. He then signalled for the boy to relax and laughed: “I had thought that the fire had attracted a wild beast, but it was just a false alarm.”

“Sorry, I’m sorry.” Kai said slightly embarrassed and laughed.

Touching his forehead, the burly man waved towards Kai Yang: “Come, the nights are cold and surviving alone here will not be easy.”

When he heard this, Kai Yang walked up and sat next to the fire. Beside him, the burly man kept looking at Kai Yang and couldn’t but feel pity when he saw Kai Yang’s thin, boney body.

Now that they were sitting together it would be natural to talk to each other. From this chat, Kai Yang learnt that this father and son pair lived at the foot of the mountain, and came here to hunt and earn a living. Although they weren’t rich, it was enough to maintain adequate food and clothing. The boy, although he was young, was a veteran at hunting. And along with his father, they had come to Black Wind Mountains many times to hunt. Thus their knowledge of the mountain was far greater than Kai Yang’s.

Kai Yang also told them a bit about himself. After he told them that he was a Sky Tower disciple, the burly man was taken aback. While the little boy became more interested in Kai Yang and kept on glancing at him with his glossy, black eyes.

The Han man said: “My son also wanted to train to become a practitioner, but his talent was not enough and he was refused. So he practically worships you people.”

This statement made Kai Yang recall the past three years and his experiences. Not only did it move him deeply, it also made him softly rub the boy’s head with affection.

When he was about to say something, Kai Yang’s stomach grumbled loudly. The little boy stared blankly and suddenly laugh out loud, from his bag he took out some dry rations and gave it Kai Yang.

This once again made him very moved, but he didn’t accept. Kai Yang looked at the burly man and he smiled: “Eat it. It seems that you did not eat anything today.”

This time Kai Yang didn’t reject the offering and quickly wolfed down the rations.

After chatting some more the three then went to sleep around the fire. Though Kai Yang didn’t dare sleep too heavily, if any danger were to approach the father and son, he would be able to react. He also considered this to be returning the favor for giving him the rations previously.

Fortunately the night passed peacefully and nothing happened.

When the morning arrived Kai Yang didn’t wait for the father and son to wake before quietly leaving. But before he left, he left two herbs behind as a thank you for last night.

If these two herbs were crumpled they had a healing effect. Since they were constantly in the mountains, these herbs were bound to be useful to the father and son pair.

With the eastern purple gas increasing in volume, Kai Yang trained the tempered body record for half an hour. When he finished his practise, Kai Yang took in a large breath of the purple gas causing his meridians to suddenly shake. A warm feeling then began surging through his body, with the energy in his meridians swirling endlessly

The tempered body fifth stage! His intuition was correct, he indeed broke through today. After practising for half an hour he really broke through to the next stage!

Kai Yang was extremely happy, and felt more and more grateful towards the golden skeleton in his body.

Although it had not been very long since he obtained the proud golden skeleton, he had broken through twice thanks to it and the tempered body record. This speed was simply unmatched. And this was practising under quite a number of restrictions. If he could practise all the time, what speed would he reach then?

This thought left Kai Yang somewhat speechless. Though after all, the tempered body was only the foundation to becoming a true warrior. Training the early stages were easier, the higher the realms, the greater the difficulty to train in.

After a quick rest Kai Yang continued to search for herbs.

Today he had yet again gained quite a harvest. He had collected more than a dozen herbs and caught a plump rabbit, solving his food problems.

This was already the the third day of his mountain journey and he had reached the end of the ten mile safety zone. Any further and Kai Yang dared not to enter inside, for with his current strength his only option was to become food for the beasts within.

Although he did not go too deep, his harvest was still quite good. He had collected more than twenty different types of herbs, and counting the previous two days he had forty different types making his journey here very fruitful. Unfortunately the two main herbs that he needed were very small in quantity.

To find forty different types of herbs in three days was no small harvest. Even if they were all ordinary grade, lower rank herbs, he was still able to exchange them for a fair amount of contribution points. But this greatly reduced his training time, doing more harm than good.

It was now the afternoon and Kai Yang had started to walk towards the track that would lead him back to Sky Tower.

Kai Yang was only given three days of leave, so he had to return before tomorrow morning, otherwise there would be harsh punishment waiting for him.

Kai Yang felt he had plenty of time and was certain that he could return before dark. Afterall, he was only hundred miles away, not a long distance.

In his heart he held great anticipation with regard to the black book’s third page. Thinking about the results it would bring for him made him delighted and put a bounce in his steps.

Halfway through his journey back Kai Yang heard an unexpected, piercing cry not to far from his position. There was the sound of a child screaming/crying mixed in.

When he heard this he paused his footsteps and strained his ears. Soon after, his face changed and Kai Yang swiftly ran towards the direction of the sound.

When he was listening to the sound, he recognised it as the sounds of the father and son pair from the night before. And that child’s crying sound was from the little boy.

Those two probably had encountered some sort of trouble, or why would they make such a ruckus. Last night they had given Kai Yang some of their rations, and even if were for their past kindness, how could he just ignore their trouble?

As he ran towards them, the father’s roaring became increasingly desperate and the boy’s grew softer and softer.

Kai Yang’s face gradually hardened and he started to have a bad feeling.

By the time Kai Yang arrived, the father’s roar could no longer be heard and he only saw a dark cave in a high hill. To the side of the cave in the midsts of some bushes, tangled between some spiderwebs was a silver bow. This bow the same one the little boy had been holding the previous night.

Without thinking, Kai Yang threw this possessions onto the ground, heightened his senses and plunged straight into that dark and sinister cave.

Although the light inside the cave was not bright, it was still enough to see.

When he looked around, Kai Yang was shocked to discover that the cave was covered in webs. On the walls and the ground, they crisscrossed each other and varied in thicknesses. Layer upon layer, the road ahead was blocked by the multitude of webs.

Not only that, the cave was damp. The water dripped down at a steady pace, and when Kai Yang took a step forward, his foot sank into the ground.

Steeling his nerves, Kai Yang walked to the sound of deep breathing. Only he saw a large human sized cocoon spun from a spider’s thread in a chrysalis-like state. At the top, it revealed a human face, that face belonged to the burly man from the night before.

Worriedly, Kai Yang dashed over to the trapped hunter, his worry eased upon discovering that he was only unconscious.

Hearing Kai Yang calling to him, the hunter groggily awoke and called feebly: “Save the child! My son was dragged further inside. I beg of you, please save my child!”

“Got dragged inside?” This shocked Kai Yang, as he struggled to free the hunter from the web. Sadly the web was too strong for his current strength, being unable to break it he could only temporarily give up. Diving into the hole, he chased after the little boy.

From behind the hunter warned: “Be careful! That is a Demonic Spider Beast!”

When he heard the words, Demonic Spider Beast, Kai Yang’s heart thumped loudly. These demonic beasts were not like ordinary wild animals; they loved to slaughter. They were true ferocious beasts and Kai Yang was not a match for even the lowest among them with his current strength.

In the Black Wind Mountains, the reason why the first thirty miles were deemed a safe zone, was precisely because there were no ferocious beasts. Unfortunately it seemed, one had appeared. This was seriously outside one’s expectations.

Now that he knew it was a ferocious beast, Kai Yang movements became more and more cautious and soft. Slowly, he groped his way through the tunnel and after about ten feet, he spotted the little boy.

The son was in a similar situation to his father, wrapped up in a cocoon which was suspended in mid air by a larger spider web.

At the side of the little boy, there was an enormously, large flower patterned spider sucking on a straw. The straw was inserted in the little boy’s arm, and you could clearly see the dark red blood streaming out from the straw and into the spider’s mouth.

On the ground of this hillside cave, were various bones of all different types of beasts piled up like mountains. One could only imagine the amount of time the Demonic Spider Beast had spent living here and the number of poor souls, humans and animals alike, that had fallen prey to it.

Kai Yang had no time to spare to think about this spider’s capabilities and form an appropriate plan. Every second he delayed, increased the chances of this little boy ascending straight to heaven. After a moments silence, he suddenly charged forward.

The enormously, large, flower patterned spider did not expect to be disturbed at that moment. Shortly after Kai Yang charged forward, a large amount of force was applied to the side of the Demonic Spider, and a large hole was torn in the web. The flower patterned spider fell alongside Kai Yang. The little boy also fell through the hole and onto the ground.

Being attacked so suddenly caused the flower patterned spider to be furious. It’s eight long, hairy legs stamped the ground, and all of its eyes focused on Kai Yang.

Before he even had to time to get up, he was pinned down by a single single pounce from the flower patterned spider.

Kai Yang snarled, a steel fist flew out and landed squarely on the throat of the spider. This momentarily stunned it, Kai Yang took the opportunity to kick the spider, sending it flying away.

With a single roll, Kai Yang got to his feet and crouched down, his eyes fully focused on the movements of that flower patterned spider.

After that small confrontation, Kai Yang’s furiously beating heart had calmed slightly. For that demonic beast’s rank was not that high, otherwise he would even be able to struggle against it. It’s most likely that it’s only a first realm demonic beast.

However even if it was only a first realm demonic beast, given Kai Yang’s current strength it was still a difficult opponent.

As both sides were sizing up their opponents, the flowered patterned spider started to show signs of impatience, and it wasn’t just him Kai Yang began to exhibit them as well.It seemed that the little boy had lost too much blood, and was showing signs of poisoning. If the current situation could not be resolved quickly, then there would be no time to save him.

Abruptly, the flower patterned spider opened its mouth to spit out a long, gem-silk thread. It spat the thread towards Kai Yang, signalling the start of its attack.

Previously, Kai Yang had learnt about this thread’s durability, so naturally he was wary to not be trapped by it. At once, he rolled to the side and narrowly dodged the attack.

The flower patterned spider didn’t show much reaction to his dodge and continued to spit out other thread pieces. By the time Kai Yang noticed the spider wasn’t aiming at him it was already too late, the entire cave had been covered by in a web of these threads, sealing off his exits and trapping him inside.

“Is it forcing me to fight to the death?” Kai Yang laughed at that thought, any fear he had previously harboured was quickly expelled by the arrogance seeping out from his bones, pumping adrenaline through his body.

With the current situation, if he didn’t kill the spider, he would not be able to leave. Since it had come to that, he could only fight to the bitter end; either you die or I die.

With time ticking, Kai Yang could not afford to delay. Firmly planting both feet on the ground, he sprinted towards the flower patterned spider. Out flew another strand of thread, fortunately Kai Yang was on guard, so how could he not avoid it?

After dodging three of these threads in succession, he had finally closed the distance between them. But before he could throw out a punch, that flower patterned spider raised its front two legs and drove them towards him.

Kai Yang could only lift up his arm to block, the spider’s forelimbs pierced through his arm.

Kai Yang roared out in pain, his blood boiled out. Not only was he not in a fearful panic, instead he had an indescribable feeling of excitement and anticipation in his heart. All of his bones clanking together caused a warm feeling passed through his entire body.

Throwing out a punch, Kai Yang’s fist whistled through the air and smashed into the eyes on the left hand side of the flower patterned spider’s head. The moment his fist hit, it pulverised two eyes.

The flower patterned spider was horrified. Even with its limited intellectual capacity, it knew to fear that human with blood dripping from their arm. When it went to retract its two legs that were lodged in Kai Yang’s arms, the spider found that the arm muscles had tightened around its forelimbs so the spider couldn’t pull them out.

Kai Yang’s second punch followed shortly after his first, pulverising another two eyes.

The flower patterned spider screeched out in pain, incessantly trying to retreat, but it’s hind legs could only scratch at the ground. In desperation, it lashed out at Kai Yang, leaving many shallow wounds on his arms. Although they weren’t deep, they still drew blood.

But, the pain only served to increase Kai Yang’s excitement, his whole body bubbled with overflowing strength. The corners of his mouth curved into a cold and merciless smile, his fists flew endlessly towards the spider’s forehead. Under the unceasing barrage of attacks, the flower patterned spider’s forehead cracked open, and its bodily fluids oozed out.

A dismal whimper escaped from its mouth, the flower patterned did not wish to sit and wait for its death. From its mouth, it spat out streams of its web, and at such close proximity, the web wrapped Kai Yang up.

However at that moment, the flower patterned spider was in a horrible state; its head was disfigured so much that it had nearly burst. If it hadn’t become a demonic beast, and gained the tenacious vitality that is associated with it, it would have already died many times over.

Since this was the case, even though it had trapped him with its web, under Kai Yang’s relentless fists, it soon ceased all signs of struggling.

Kai Yang would have never imagined he could win a fight with a demonic beast. Furthermore, not only had he survived, he had also killed it.

Even though it was a first realm demonic beast, it was still not something a cultivator at the tempered body fifth stage should be able to defeat. Although Kai Yang’s wounds weren’t considered light, he didn’t feel much pain from them; as if they nothing at all.

After certifying that the flower patterned spider was truly dead, Kai Yang went to extract the leg that had pierced into his arm. When he pulled it out, a gush of warm blood followed.

(TL: O.O, you just casually pulled something that was stabbed into your arm? Oh it’s stuck, let’s pull it out.)

Without even pausing to inspect his injuries, Kai Yang tore apart the spider web that was binding him and rushed to the little boy’s side; gently cradling his body he brought him out of the cave.

The little boy’s father had managed to finally escape from his web cocoon. And just as he was preparing to run further into the cave, he saw a blood-drenched Kai Yang carry out his son. He quickly inquired: “What happened to him?”

“He has lost too much blood and has also been poisoned.” Kai Yang replied.

After reaching the cave’s entrance, Kai Yang placed the little boy onto the ground and raced towards his fallen bag. Taking out some of the herbs inside, he began chewing on them. Without hesitation he called over the hunter: “Chew on these herbs to soften them, then feed them to him.”

The hunter was already scared out of his wits, so when he heard Kai Yang’s orders, he didn’t hesitate. Swiftly, he placed the herbs into his mouth and began to chew them diligently.

In that moment, Kai Yang’s mind was all too clear; his understanding of each herb’s medicinal properties began to appear in his mind within his mind. Which herbs could detoxify, which herbs could help with healing, which herbs could help staunch blood flow, the knowledge flowing through his mind was comparable to that of a veteran pharmacist.

After a short period of time, Kai Yang took out the herbs he had been chewing on and smeared them over the little boy’s arm. The hunter followed his actions and began to feed the chewed up herbs to his son.

Under the nervous gazes of the two people, colour gradually returned to the boy’s pale face and his breathing steadied.

The hunter could finally release the tension in his heart and fell on his buttocks. Crying out loudly he said: ”Fortunately nothing happened, fortunately nothing happened........”

Kai Yang poured cold water on his new found hope: “Not yet, my herbs are only low levelled ones and can only alleviate his symptoms.You have to leave the mountain and find a doctor, otherwise I’m afraid that the poison will become incurable. ”

The hunter could only listen to Kai Yang’s advice. Immediately he said: “Then I shall go take him to find a doctor now.”

“There’s no hurry.” said Kai Yang as he held out his hand to stop him. “Allow your son to stabilise first then move him.”

“Oh, what the saviour says is correct.” With such a great catastrophe befalling on the hunter, he had long since lost his nerve. So whatever Kai Yang said, he would follow.

After replying, he remembered that his saviour was also injured. His injuries were not light, so he worriedly asked: “Saviour, do you not want to also treat your own wounds.”

Kai Yang replied: “Not need.”

“But you have shed such a large amount of blood, how is that alright?” The Hunter looked at him in shock.

“I don’t know.” Standing up, Kai Yang jumped up and down vivaciously. “Even I don’t know, but I feel great.”

He not only felt great, but also excited. Kai Yang suspected all this was somehow related to his golden skeleton, but how could he explain it to a simple hunter? As he thought back to the recent fight, Kai Yang’s blood began to boil once again.

That was the very first time he had ever been in a life or death situation. But he had not experienced even the slightest amount of fear, instead he had only felt enjoyment at the feeling of blood splattering all around him. Like it was the most common occurrence.

(TL: The birth of an asura/bloodthirsty demon/demon king???)

“That’s right, please wait a bit. I will return soon.” As he picked up his bag, Kai Yang once again rushed into the cave.

The hunter thought he had gone to sort out the demonic beast’s corpse, but that was not it.

Although the flower patterned spider was a demonic beast, it’s corpse didn’t hold any value; it was too low levelled.

Kai Yang’s goal was to pick herbs growing inside the cave!

Before he had begun his battle with the flower patterned spider, he had discovered a large amount of purple coloured flowers. Previously he didn’t have the time to examine them, but now that he thought back to them, his spirits couldn’t help but rise.

If he didn’t see incorrectly, those purple coloured flowers were actually the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers that he desperately needed.

(TL: here comes his xianxia luck!!!!)

Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers grew in dark and damp places with a lot of corpses. Making this cave an ideal environment for them to grow in.

With his heart full of anticipation as he entered the cave, Kai Yang nearly laughed, such was his joy.

Helping others will really reward you well. It seemed that this saying was true! If he had not come to rescue the father and son pair, then he would never have found the herbs that he was looking for.

The vast expanse of purple flowers in front of him truly were the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flowers. Plus, there appeared to be a vast quantity of them; a quick count showed there were at least thirty to forty of these flowers. These small purple flowers, all bunched together would make anyone who saw them feel delighted.

Without further ado, Kai Yang hurriedly took out his shovel and started to harvest these herbs.

While he busied himself, Kai Yang’s heart was more than content. Just as he was preparing to leave the cave, Kai Yang discovered a red, mushroom like plant in the corner of the cave.

His curiosity piqued, Kai Yang walked towards it to carefully examine it. This thing was about the size of a bowl, dark red and was like a mushroom or fungus. Kai Yang didn’t recognise this thing, for it was not mentioned in the little book that Treasurer Meng had given him.

Could it be a priceless treasure? Rolling up his sleeves, Kai Yang went to pick the mushroom like plant. As for the matter of its identity, he could work it later; it wouldn’t take much space up anyway.

By the time Kai Yang exited the cave, his bag was filled to the brim.

“Let’s go, I will descend the mountain with you.” Kai Yang told the the hunter, treating him like an equal.

“Many thanks to the saviour.” The hunter was moved to tears, for he knew that Kai Yang was worried they would encounter more danger on the journey out. That’s why he was following them.

“We just happen to be travelling the same path, no need for thanks.” Kai Yang replied humbly, and the three of them quickly descended the mountain.

By evening they had arrived back at town, and in the dark, they searched for the doctor’s home.

Even after settling the little boy, Kai Yang wasn’t in a rush to leave. Afterall, that night, the little boy had given him some of his rations. So he had to stay until the boy opened his eyes; only after that would his heart be at peace.

Inside, the hunter was paced around restlessly, worried about his boy. Before long, the doctor shooed him out — saying he was too noisy.

“Doctor Chu said it is fortunate we did some emergency treatment. Otherwise my son would have truly lost his life. Saviour, your mercy and kindness I will be forever unable to repay. Even if I worked hard my entire life, I will be unable.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the hunter knelt down in front of Kai Yang.

Kai Yang did not help him up but smiled and said: “Big brother Zhang, men only kneel before gold. With you kneeling, you have harmed our good relationship, you do not need to kneel in the future. I also ate some of your child’s rations, if you are talking about owing, then I owe you too.”

After finishing his sentence, he went to help hunter Zhang up.

Hunter Zhang was moved to tears: “Saviour, you truly are a good person!”

As they were speaking, the doctor walked outside and said to hunter Zhang: “It is no longer dangerous, so you need not worry. But because he has lost a large amount of blood, he will be asleep for a while longer but once he wakes up, he’ll be fine.”

When they heard those words, Kai Yang and hunter Zhang both let out sighs of relief.

Once he relaxed Kai Yang felt a wave of exhaustion flow through his body. Today had been far too exciting, he had also received many wounds and lost a lot of blood. Even with his previous energy, his body had still received damage, so when he relaxed himself, he fell asleep; sleeping until the sun rose.

Early in the morning, Sky Tower.

Many of the disciples woke up early, with high spirits. Together they gathered in a certain region, waiting in anticipation. Thirsty eyes, craned necks, a unruly state of mind; these things were consistent throughout the crowd. Together they surrounded the house like a housewife who had waited many years for her husband to return home. Exemplifying that devotion and expectation.

With the passing of time, the number of people who gathered gradually increased. It was like they were telepathically connected, everybody turned their heads at the same time to look at one place.

That place was the path that lead to the residence of Kai Yang, a small little hut.

Today was the day when they could once again challenge Kai Yang! This was equivalent to a free contribution point box, how could these disciples give up this golden opportunity? Some people pitied Kai Yang’s predicament, for every five days he was challenged and beaten to a pulp. This was really a bit too brutal.

However sympathy alone could not help Kai Yang. Even if they did not challenge him, many others would gladly take their place. In the end, he will still be beaten to a pulp, so they might as well do it themselves, at least they could take it easy on him. When they thought about it like that, they all came to try their luck.

En, if he chose me, I will definitely hit lightly, so he will not be injured too badly. Many people were making excuses like this in their hearts.

Typically Kai Yang was already awake and had begun to sweep the area by this time, but it was really strange today. Even after waiting quite a while, they still had not seen Kai Yang. Even when they tiptoed over to look around, they could not find him.

“What’s with Kai Yang? Did he oversleep? How come he has yet to come out?”

“I don’t know, thinking about it, has anyone has seen him in these past few days?”

“Could it be that he has already left Sky Tower?”

“Impossible, it’s not like you don’t know about Kai Yang’s stubbornness. Even if you killed him, he would not leave. If he really wanted to leave, he would have left a couple months ago, when he was made into a trial disciple. Why would he wait such a long time just to leave in the end anyway?”

Surprisingly with all the discussion going on, no one knew that a few days prior, Kai Yang had asked for leave to enter the Black Wind Mountains and had yet to return. Though this was no surprise, for during normal days, Kai Yang did not interact much with others, and so naturally no one knew of his whereabouts.

While this group were making a ruckus, a person had started to walk towards this crowd. His face was flawless like jade, and his body also like jade, he really was a handsome youth. But no one knew why at that moment, this youth’s expression was very gloomy. As he walked, he was gnashing his teeth and cursing someone.

Following behind this youth, were a large number of Sky Tower disciples. Surrounding him, they made him the centre of attention.

While the youth was surrounded he showed a very unpleasant face. He said in doubt: “Why is it? Why are there so many people here?”

In response to his request someone hurriedly came up to him and informed him in a lowered voice: “Master Su, today is the day when we can challenge Kai Yang. So many fellow disciples have gathered here today to collect some contribution points.”

The youth that was called Master Su furrowed his eyebrows before laughing heartedly. “Looks like our fellow disciple Kai Yang is in an abyss of suffering.”

His words were full delight at Kai Yang’s misfortune.

“En. Basically he is challenged every five days. Not only that, he will not admit defeat unless he can no longer stand properly.” The person who had spoken earlier further explained.

Master Su laughed again: “En, this young master feels that the resentment in his heart has decreased greatly. But this is not enough, I must make him leave Sky Tower. For as long as he is not a Sky Tower disciple I can do whatever I please with him and no one can say a word.”

“Master Su is right. That brat dared to tarnish your good name, he really cannot differentiate between a noble and a horse. He doesn’t even bother to inquire as to Master Su’s identity. He is too arrogant!”

This ass-kissing made Master Su feel much better, causing him to repeatedly nod his head.

Master Su, whose reputation Kai Yang had tarnished, was exactly the same Su Mu he had met in Black Plum Village. It was the same Su Mu, along with the two Han men, upon whom Kai Yang had enforced justice. Because of this, Su Mu had flown into a rage, enquiring around Sky tower on the identity of Jai Yang.

In the end, he had found out about the ins and outs about Kai Yang in less than a day. Afterall, he did have his own network of connections and channels. But under the iron rule of the Main Gate, he could not easily move his hand and had waited until this day to bring a bunch of people over to cause trouble for Kai Yang. Unfortunately he didn’t expect that so many other people would also come for Kai Yang.

This made Su Mu somewhat displeased, Waving his hand, he said: “Make them leave. Tell that today, Kai Yang will only be mine today.”

This statement made Kai Yang sound like some sort of young girl, or like an available prostitute, ready to be brought.

The person next to him promptly walked into the crowd, cupped his hands and said: “Fellow disciples, today’s battle with Kai Yang, Master Su has already reserved it. So I ask my fellow disciples to please line up at the door and watch. I am sorry any inconvenience.”

This announcement took many by surprise. They all turned to Su Mu in confusion and asked: “Why should we? Everytime, Kai Yang would use his broom to choose the opponent, so for what reason should we allow you to fight him? Even if he did not choose, shouldn’t it be first come, first served?”

After that was said, someone pulled at the speaker and whispered to them: “That is Su Mu. Do you know who Su Mu is?”

“Who?” This person had just been accepted, so he really didn’t know who Su Mu was.

“Idiot! There is an Elder who is surnamed Su, there is also a core disciple within the top ten surnamed Su. Why don’t you say who he is?” That person spoke.

Although the one listening didn’t nod his head in understanding, he still understood the meaning behind those words. He had been temporarily stunned by the information. When he heard that Su Mu had such powerful people backing him, how could he dare make another sound?

“Winning against Kai Yang will not even earn me many contribution points, so it’s best not to offend him.”

“Yes yes yes.” The person replied while cold sweat dripped down his back.

Su Mu was very satisfied with the reaction to his demand, but witnessing this made him snort softly in disdain.

Although today’s battle with Kai Yang had been secured by Su Mu, the crowd had yet to disperse. They didn’t know what Kai Yang had done to offend Su Mu, so of course they wanted to stay behind and watch the show.

After waiting for some time, Kai Yang still hadn’t appeared. Su Mu impatiently asked: “Where is he?”

“I don’t know. Usually, he is already out sweeping the grounds by this time, so I don’t why he has yet to come out. Master Su, should we check his hut?”

After thinking for a bit, Su Mu nodded and replied: “That’s a good idea. He is just a small and insignificant sweeper, yet he dares to make this Master Su painstakingly wait for him. I will make him pay for this later!”

The location of Kai Yang’s residence was no secret, so the people around Su Mu swiftly lead the way.

The ones who had stayed behind to watch the show also followed, creating a grand procession of disciples.

A short while later, the procession of people had arrived at Kai Yang’s small hut. When they saw the pitiful and wretched state of his hut, with holes littering the hut walls, they were not surprised. For no apparent reason, Su Mu lifted his hand pointed at the hut: “That brat lives here?”

“In response to Master Su’s question, because Kai Yang is a trial disciple, he must provide for all his own clothing, food, housing and training materials. The Main Gate will definitely not provide them for him. This hut was probably built by his own hands.”

“Good good good.” Su Mu laughed happily. Thinking about how drenched Kai Yang would become on rainy days elevated his spirits.

Sighing, Su Mu controlled his smile and strode confidently, like a dragon or a proud like tiger, forward. With a loud voice, taking care to clearly articulate each word he called out: “You, Kai Yang. Get your arse out for this Master Su and prepare to receive a nice beating!”

That loud shout was powerful, like a storm and yet unlike a storm it was not detached and uncaring it was filled with utter hatred.The hatred and bloodthirsty desire, made everyone present shiver in their shoes. This clearly displayed the level hatred between Kai Yang and Su Mu to the crowd, evidently it was not a small issue.

Su Mu stood their, exuding a majestic presence, in this moment it appeared that not even the eight winds could move him. After he finished shouting, he waited expectantly outside the door for Kai Yang to coming running out, while pissing his pants, and crying to beg for mercy. The more he thought about it, the more arrogant be became.

But no matter how long he waited, there was not a even a hint of movement within the hut.

Su Mu’s face was now full of rage, snarling he called out again: “Kai Yang, be a smart one and get your arse out here. Otherwise we will come inside and drag you out.”

Yet, there was still no reply.

Su Mu now felt there was something odd, for if Kai Yang was really inside, there should be at least sounds of him breathing. Could it be that he was not inside?

Su Mu signalled one the people around him exaggeratedly. That person promptly sprang forward, forcefully kicked down the wooden door and rushed into the small hut.

Not long after they had entered, that person ran out again and reported to Su Mu: “Master Su, there is no one inside. There is also a small accumulation of dust. Looks like this trash knew that a calamity was approaching, so had fled already.”

“Fled?” Su Mu nearly vomited blood in anger. He had racked his brains, scheming for many days all in preparation for this day, the day he would get to exact his revenge and make up for the shame he suffered at the hands of Kai Yang. He had even brought many disciples to come and watch the show, yet that Kai Yang had unexpectedly fled?

This was like a powerful punch had been let out, but landed on a piece of cotton. It made Su Mu feel gloomy and depressed.

“Speaking about it, these past fews, we haven’t seen even a hair of Kai Yang.”

“A wise man will submit to the circumstances. Since Kai Yang had offended this Su Mu, he probably knew that all hell would break loose. Forcing him to leave the Main Gate.”

“No wonder even after waiting such a long time, he had yet to appear.”

“Ah! Now that Kai Yang has left, we will no longer be able to obtain easy contribution points.”

The crowd muttered softly, none of their mutterings escaped Su Mu’s ears.

Although he was pleased by the respect they were showing him, he hadn’t been able to extract his revenge. Thus Su Mu’s heart was still unsatisfied.

After thinking for awhile, with a gloomy face, Su Mu could only accept the fact he would not get to extract his revenge on Kai Yang today. In a fit of rage he said: “That trash really got lucky, however my anger will not dissipate, I will get something. Burn down this pitiful hut.”

This demand alarmed everybody present, even the people Su Mu had brought with him were stunned. One asked: “Master Su, is it a good idea to start a fire inside the school?”

“What are you afraid of?” Su Mu eyed him: “Even if the sky falls down, I will be there to catch it. Furthermore, it isn’t even important to the school. So what if it is destroyed, it wouldn’t be much of a loss. Also, leaving this ragged hut standing will harm this younger master’s eyes.”

Hearing him say that, dispelled the concerns within their hearts. With the Master Su as backing them, burning this hut is nothing.

Before they lit the fire, some went to look for dry grass to use as kindling.

After awhile, everything was prepared. Grinning, Su Mu lit a torch, its flames distorted his face greatly making him appear evil?.

“Kai Yang, I warn you never to let me see your face in the future. Otherwise I will not let you live or die!” Su Mu said while grinding his teeth. Just as he was preparing to throw the torch into the hut, a person to his side tapped his shoulder and whilst releasing a bloodthirsty aura enquired of him: “What is this for?”

Su Mu didn’t even need to think before replying: “Burning a house.”

“Why are you burning my house?” That person’s voice carried a hint of anger.

“Your house?” Su Mu curled his lip ferociously and turned his head. As soon as he saw the speaker, he immediately jumped to the side like a frightened rabbit seeing a wolf. Then with an exaggerated movement, he assumed a defensive posture. His face was filled with alarm and the hairs on the back of his neck all rose.

It was because the appearance of the person who had spoken was too frightening. Not only were his clothes all tattered, his hair was messed up, with plants sticking out all over the place and dirty beyond compare. His body also displayed numerous bloody marks, his clothes were bloodstained and a bulging bag was tied around his back. God only knew what was in there.

A gentle breeze blew past, causing his tattered pants to flap revealing a strong and sturdy leg covered in leg hair.

The wind carried with it the stench from Kai Yang’s several dirty body, Su Mu was unable to stomach that smell. That appearance, coupled with the blood and smell made Su Mu want to vomit up his three meals.

That posture, that manner, was strangely familiar.

If he were to hold a broken bowl in one hand, then he would look exactly like a beggar.

But.......why did he feel that this horrifying person looked familiar?

Su Mu looked more closely, becoming more and more confused. After he thought for a while he cried out: “Kai Yang!”

If it’s not Kai Yang, then who could it be? Even though his body shape had changed and his face was covered in filth, how could Su Mu, who hated Kai Yang deep down in his bones, not recognise him? If he could he not recognise him then who could?

Kai Yang also recognised Su Mu. Grinning widely, he revealed a set of ivory white teeth. “If it isn’t fellow disciple Su who brazenly tried to frame others in Black Plum Village?”

The voice that said so was full of ridicule, turning Su Mu’s white face a deep red. Stamping his foot Su Mu retorted: “Kai Yang, you did not choose to walk the path to heaven but chose to walk through hell’s gates! You are destined to die today!”

“You want to find issue with me?” His brow creasing, Kai Yang asked.

“Nonsense!” Su Mu cried proudly. “You thought I came to see you?”

“If you have something to settle with me, come and find me. Why do you need to burn down my house?” Kai Yang questioned.

Su Mu promptly threw the touch away and rushed to step on it; like he was stamping on Kai Yang directly. Venting on the torch, after a while, the torch was finally stamped out.

This moment of pause allowed the people present to understand what was happening. They finally realised that Kai Yang had not run away from fear of Su Mu, but rather that he had only left to complete some business.

But what business did he have to complete which had caused his appearance to become so appalling? Such bloodiness, isn’t it a bit too much? Also the tears in his clothes were obviously made by some sort of sharp weapon. Who did he go and fight with? And was it a life and death type of fight?

Those bloody wounds naturally came from the fight with the flower patterned spider. Back then he didn’t have enough time to treat them, because he had to bring the little boy back to the village to see a doctor and then he had collapsed from exhaustion and immediately fallen asleep once he knew the child was safe.

Kai Yang had slept until the next morning without waking. And after he saw that the little boy was awake and well, Kai Yang had hurried back to the Sect. When he drew near, he saw a hoard of people surrounding his home. They all held torches and looked like they were going to burn down his home. But how could he allow this? Naturally he would go and ask why they were doing this, but he didn’t expect it would be Su Mu who came to look for trouble.

Just as the owner of the house appeared, Su Mu who had intended to burn it down, did not even feel the tiniest bit guilty. Instead he felt excited and pointed towards Kai Yang: “Kai Yang, don’t you dare say that this young master did not give you a chance. So if only you will......”

“Wait a moment.” Kai Yang lifted his hand to stop him, and then leisurely entered his hut.

“Hey........” With his words stopped halfway, Su Mu felt like he ate a fly; the ones that liked to appear before dung piles. He felt extremely uncomfortable.

“Master Su, this person doesn’t give one face at all.” Someone cried out seeking justice for Su Mu.

“Humph!” Sneering Su Mu said: “Later, help me beat him ruthlessly, for I heard that this brat never surrenders. So no need to be soft with your strikes. Today, I must teach him the consequences for offending this young master.”

“Yes.”

When he entered his hut, Kai Yang took off the bag on his back. Inside this bag were herbs, his precious harvest from the three days he spent on the mountain. If he didn’t secure their safety first, his heart wouldn’t be at rest.

When he put the bag safely away, Kai Yang exited his hut and said to Su Mu with a serious face: “What was it that you wanted to tell me?”

Su Mu looked at him, his face a picture of abhorrence. His face full of bitterness, like he was going to spit out a mouthful of blood.

Previously, before he could say his perfectly rehearsed lines, he had been interrupted by Kai Yang. But now that Kai Yang had asked him what he wanted to say, he couldn’t wait and yelled out: “Kai Yang, don’t you dare say that his young master did not give you a chance. So as long you are willing to kneel down and kowtow for me in front of all the fellow disciples present and call me your grandfather, I will spare your life! Or else.......humph, humph, humph.......”

The message was very clear, explicitly implying the threat unsaid.

When he finished, Su Mu’s face was filled with his desire for revenge; it really showed how he felt about Kai Yang.

Slowly Kai Yang nodded his head, grievingly he looked at Su Mu.

“What?” Su Mu was unsure, for Kai Yang’s face was calm and composed. This made him somewhat restless, for he had been played around with by him before in Black Plum Village. He was still a bit traumatised from the experience.

“Unfilial!” Kai Yang sighed.

The crowd was stunned, Su Mu was stunned, they were all thinking how was this unfilial?

“What do you mean?” Su Mu viciously asked.

“Isn’t clear? Let me teach you!” With a face of good intent, Kai Yang earnestly said: “Let me ask you, do you have elders in Sky Tower?”

“Looks like you really do have eyes!” This made Su Mu’s tail rise up into the heavens.

Kai Yang smiled. For it was just like he guessed; Su Mu had someone to back him up. Otherwise how would he dare to act so brazenly as to burn his house.

“Your elder must have no small amount of power within the Main Gate right?” Kai Yang asked again.

“He’s an elder!” Su Mu snorted out. “I also have an older sister who is a core disciple! As long as she wishes for it, a single finger will be able to kill you!”

Kai Yang understood, he had a general understanding about the ins and outs of Su Mu’s character. Patting his back he said: “That’s right, so unfilial!”

“What is right or wrong?” Su Mu was furious. He was pulled around in circles by Kai Yang and now his mind was a mess. And he still didn’t know what he meant.

“Such an easy affair and yet you still don’t understand. How has your mind developed?” His brow creasing, Kai Yang looked at Su Mu pitifully and patiently explained: “With your older sister’s position, then she would be my senior. If I were to really call you that, then how would your older sister call you? Then what would that elder call you? Unfilial. How unfilial! If I were that elder, I would you lock you up in the Destitute Dragon Stream. So that in this life, you can’t even dream about leaving it.”

Su Mu’s entire body shook and his face paled. Destitute Dragon Stream is a region in Sky Tower that was the most frightening place in the entire school. In the hundreds of years since the school’s founding, any disciple that was found to have broken rules or committed heinous crimes was thrown into that region and never seen again. As long as you were thrown in Destitute Dragon Stream, you were a dead man.

Destitute Dragon Stream; these three words were well-known in the surrounding thousand of miles. It’s infamy was spread far and wide.

Su Mu wasn’t afraid of Kai Yang, however those three words struck fear into his very soul.

One of the people that Su Mu brought with him sensed something was off with Su Mu and hurriedly said: “Master Su, this brat’s mouth is very sharp, making him this confident. The reason why we came today, was to help you vent your anger.”

“En.” Regaining his senses, Su Mu shouted indignantly to hide his embarrassment: “Kai Yang, don’t talk about nonsense. If you will not kneel down and beg for forgiveness, then this young master will make you wish that you were never born in this life.”

His eyes glinting coldly, Kai Yang held up his fists: “Disciple Su, why don’t you come and exchange some blows with me?”

Su Mu replied in contempt: “I would like to, unfortunately you don’t live up to expectations. You are not qualified! This master is at the tempered body ninth stage!”

Hearing this, Kai Yang understood. The Main Gate rules state that if you want to challenge other disciples, the level difference must not exceed more than three levels. Su Mu really couldn’t duel Kai Yang, their level difference was far too large.

This was also the reason why Su Mu had brought people over with him, they weren’t just here to watch the show.

With a face full of loathing, a cold smile, Su Mu tilted his head towards Kai Yang: “Everybody, this Yang disciple has reached the tempered body third stage. So which brother here is willingly to fight him?”

“Tempered body third stage, what a high stage!” Everybody roared in laughter, for none of them had entered earlier than Kai Yang. Yet which one of them was not higher than him?

“Allow me to Master Su, for my cultivation is within the limit. Though I am only at the tempered body fifth stage. It should be enough to play satisfy disciple Kai Yang!” A disciple said while walking through the crowd and looking disdainfully at Kai Yang.

Kai Yang looked back at him laughing; their information was already long outdated.

If it were five days earlier, he really would be at the tempered body third stage, but it is now longer the same story.

But of course, these types of things Kai Yang wouldn’t publicise. To advance two stages in five days, this speed was far too strange, such a monstrous thing would only attract unwanted attention.

A person who had come with Su Mu said: “Yang disciple, I am called Zhao Hu. You must remember who it was, that beat you today!”

“I have remembered it.” Kai Yang replied seriously.

Looks like that Zhou Hu was intentionally trying to give Su Mu face thought Kai Yang. Walking to face Kai Yang, he exaggeratedly waved his fingers: “Yang disciple, in order to not allow you to say I didn’t give you face, I will allow you three moves. As long as you can make me take one step, it will be your victory. If not, please don’t think of this disciple’s strikes as ruthless.”

This act of provocation contained the red fruit of contempt. To Su Mu, who was watching this, his heartbeat quickened in anticipation. This child Zhao Hu, he really knew how to thoroughly humiliate others. His choice of words wasn’t bad.

Although the difference between the tempered body third stage and the tempered body fifth stage consisted of only two stages, there was a large gap between each stage. Between these those two stages, there was a gap as large as a river separating them. And the strength that could be released when comparing the two were on completely different levels, like heaven and earth for these low level practitioners.

Oh by the way

Atmospheric sense → Atmospheric energy (Didn’t make sense anymore so we changed it.)

Besides, currently Kai Yang was in a very sorry state; with one look you could see that he had experienced some sort of tribulation. How much strength did he have remaining to fight? Additionally he was very skinny and malnourished to begin with, easily allowing others to look down upon him.

Practically everybody present believed that Kai Yang would be unable to escape the calamity today. Even Xia Ning Chang who was situated in a nearby tree felt the same way.

Xia Ning Chang, who had become a Dark Hall disciple, had come once again to record the outcome of Kai Yang’s battle.

“How is this allowed. I cannot allow my fellow disciple to be disadvantaged.” Kai Yang asked, hesitating slightly.

“There is nothing to worry about.” Insisted Zhou Hu. “Since I became a disciple, allowing you these three moves is something I should do! Ha ha!”

“Okay then.” Kai Yang replied, looking somewhat reluctant: “Since Zhou disciple said so, then this senior will not be impolite.”

“Bring it on!” Zhou Hu bellowed loudly, while he steadied himself and planted his two feet firmly onto the ground. His body’s muscles bulged and his blue veins popped out all over his body.

On the other side, Kai Yang walked forward step by step, his thin arms and legs tensed. Zhou Hu sneered internally and thought: ‘Just with your weak physique, merely one breath from me and I will be able to blow you away. So what strength could you possibly reveal?’

Leisurely strolling forwards, Kai Yang walked up to Zhou Hu. He balled up his fist, slowly waved it in front of him. Smiling he cautioned: “Zhou disciple, I senior will now really hit you.”

“Come then!”

Just as those words came out, Kai Yang’s fist had already been released; striking right into Zhou Hu’s abdomen.

“Bang!” That sound rang out, however none of the people present saw Kai Yang act; that fist which strangely hit Zhou Hu.

As his face paled, Zhou Hu couldn’t help but clutch his stomach and had to take a few steps backwards.

“Bang!” The second fist had already arrived before he could recover. It landed on his abdomen once again. Zhou Hu bent over clutching his stomach, as he felt his stomach acids rising up.

“Pa!” Kai Yang kicked out and hit Zhou Hu’s chin. He cried out once before falling to the ground, motionless.

He won!

A great silence ensued, it was so quiet that you could have even heard a pin drop. One by one, everyone looked at Kai Yang, the shock apparent on their faces. Su Mu’s eyes were especially wide, so wide that they looked like they were about to fall out of their sockets.

Two punches, one kick was all it took to send Zhou Hu, who was at the tempered body fifth stage, flying away. Fu*k! Is this really the strength of someone who is at the tempered body third stage?

Although from the start of the battle to the end, Zhou Hu did not retaliate, this power was far too much. A person who weighed about one hundred pounds was struck so hard he fly a few feet out. If you didn’t exert some serious effort, how could this occur? Not to mention that speed was unparalleled. One moment Zhou Hu was smiling arrogantly, and the next he was unconscious.

They could not believe the battle that had just occurred before their very eyes. Not to mention Xia Ning Chang, who was sitting in the tree and needed to record the battle.

In her small book, it clearly stated that Kai Yang won the battle. In the past two years, he had been in one hundred and forty-seven battles and had lost them all. Unexpectedly he had changed this record today!

He had also won the battle in a swift and efficient manner. Originally, Xia Ning Chang was gracefully standing on a branch, channelling her energy to balance herself. But due to the shock of his victory, she momentarily lost her concentration and fell off the branch, plummeting to the ground.

A Masked female could be seen crashing down from a thirty foot high tree. As she fell butt first down to the ground, you could hear her screaming “Ai~ya!”.

Thankfully she had fast reflexes and an equally fast reaction speed. At the last moment she channeled some energy into her body to cushion the fall. Otherwise she would have come out with far more serious injuries. Though her buttocks still burned in pain causing her, muscles to tense; hot enough to make water steam.

As she stood and enduring the pain,one could see her two beautiful legs shaking. Xia Ning Chang looked around nervously, but realised there was nobody present and released a sigh of relief.

If this scene was seen by others, then she would have lost much face.

Activating her internal energy, she dissapitated the pain on her bottom. Her eyes glinted, for Xia Ning Change could not wrap her head around Kai Yang’s strength. He was just gone for a few days, so how did his strength increase this much?

Those people who had witnessed the scene naturally could not be compared to Xia Ning Chang. Their cultivation was far lower than hers, so they couldn’t see the truth of the matter.

In that moment when Kai Yang had struck out, Xia Ning Chang clearly felt the atmospheric energy within Kai Yang’s channels had been aroused. This clearly demonstrated that he was at least at the tempered body fourth stage, additionally it even looked like his actual strength surpassed this stage.

But wasn’t he only at the tempered body third stage a few days ago?

That damn disciple! He unexpectedly hid his true strength, and not only did he give everyone a shock, he also made some fall out of trees. This was hateful to the extreme!

Unconsciously, Xia Ning Chang had placed all the blame upon Kai Yang for her sore bottom.

Kai Yang glanced over to the place where Xia Ning Chang was hidden. When she had fallen, Kai Yang managed to hear her short scream, but because the distance between them was too large he hadn’t been able to spot her. Since he didn’t find anything abnormal he didn’t investigate further. He then wrinkled his eyebrows, as he looked down at his clenched fist, he felt somewhat unsatisfied.

Of course Kai Yang was unsatisfied, for it was his very first battle with another human since he had obtained the golden body. Due to the fact that he hadn’t controlled his strength properly, Zhou Hu was sent flying away. Originally he had only planned to send his opponent back a few steps, but it looked like his power was a bit greater than what he had imagined.

At the scene, Su Mu was the first to recover. As he pointed his finger to Kai Yang, he yelled loudly: “You cheated!”

Kai Yang turned around and calmly looked at Su Mu: “Su Disciple, you can eat whatever you want to, but you cannot say words recklessly. When did I cheat?”

Su Mu was at a loss for words. It was true, when did he cheat? Zhou Hu had intentionally stood there and declared that he would take three strikes. Unexpectedly he was truly defeated in three moves. Under the numerous gazes of the crowd, how could he possibly cheat? How could he cheat?

“Master Su, it seems that our information was not correct. This brat is not at the tempered body third stage! I’m afraid that he has already ranked up, otherwise how could he possibly defeat Zhou Hu?” Someone who had keen eyes and a shrewd mind quickly realised, whispering in Su Mu’s ear.

“So it was like this.” Su Mu nodded, his face darkening. “Zhou Hu was too arrogant. If he had retaliated, how could he lose?”

In Su Mu’s mind, he thought that the reason why Zhou Hu lost was because he had underestimated his opponent. For he believed no matter how much Kai Yang ranked up, he would have only gone up to the tempered body fourth stage. With that large gap in mind, if Zhou Hu had retaliated, then Kai Yang would have been the one to be utterly defeated.

“Brother Kai Yang, you have done well to hide your strength!” Su Mu said coldly and gloomily to Kai Yang. Today he had failed to extract his revenge, so the suffocating feeling within his heart was not gone

Kai Yang shrugged his shoulders.

“Let us settle the score later. Next time, you will not be so lucky!” Su Mu coldly declared to Kai Yang. Then with a wave of his hand, he started to lead the people back, while also motioning for some to carry the unconscious Zhou Hu. But before he left, he directed one final bitter glare at Kai Yang.

This enmity has been sealed for now, though Kai Yang didn’t mind. In any case, in the Main Gate, there was only the Main Gate’s rules. So if you wanted to cause any trouble, you could only do it in the form of duels.

Moreover, he still needed to spar with others, otherwise he wouldn’t know the true extent of his growth. With that in mind, Kai Yang thought that the feud between Su Mu and himself was a blessing disguise.

Today’s battle was not exciting enough, ah, Kai Yang was left feeling unsatisfied.

With Su Mu gone, the entertainment gone, the crowd naturally dispersed. Though many of them still replayed the recent miracle in their minds, of that two year trial disciple Kai Yang. He had obtained his first victory. Although it was very fast, he had still won.

News of this battle was soon a hot topic between fellow disciples, with others seeking out those present to hear the details. If not for Su Mu’s status, then the news would have long since been spread to the ends of the earth. However since Su Mu was involved, the disciples could only hide it within their stomachs, discreetly talking about it.

In Kai Yang’s small hut, it had finally calmed down.

Looking at the sky, Kai Yang became depressed. Because Su Mu had come to cause trouble, he had lost precious time to practise the tempered body record. It was truly regrettable.

Taking out his spare pair of clothes, Kai Yang then went to the small pond beside his hut. Taking off his tattered clothes, he prepared to take a bath. These past few days he had been wondering the mountain and then he had fought the flower patterned spider, these two things combined had really made him smell funny.

Stealthily, Xia Ning Chang tip toed to the side of the hut, for she wanted to learn the true level of this fellow disciple. Yet when she turned the corner, all that met her eyes were a pair of white buttocks. Kai Yang had already become stark naked, not a stitch of clothing remained and he was in the position to dive into the water.

Xia Ning Chang’s small face immediately flushed a bright red. Although her cultivation was very high, she was still an innocent female. Not even mentioning buttocks, she hadn’t even seen a male’s thigh. How could she possibly endure this scene?

Too provoking! Xia Ning Chang’s heart had begun to thump erratically and she quickly hid herself.

How.... she today.........why did they have this fate? Tears streamed down that pitiful girl’s face, there was no time to find out his secret. Stamping her foot, she disappeared in a flash.

That stinking disciple. Those entrance examinations conducted by the teachers were too lax. Disciples stripping stark naked in broad daylight is too shameless. Far too shameless!

In the pond, Kai Yang was washing his body and inspecting it.

He had discovered that ever since he started to practise the tempered body record, his muscles had become sturdier and more robust. Although he was still thin, he was thin in the right places.

Additionally, the wounds from yesterday’s battle with the flower patterned spider had already become scars. Only the arm wound from the flower patterned spider’s leg had yet to fully heal; it was still a bit painful.

After all, it had penetrated through his arm, so it couldn’t possibly heal that quickly. But it wasn’t as severe as he had imagined, give it a few days and should be completely healed.

Thinking over that life and death battle with the spider, caused Kai Yang to be excited. Not knowing why, the more dangerous the situation he was in, the more enthusiastic and excited he became. He unexpectedly had this type of character, was he unconsciously a masochist and after living a bit more than ten years, he had suddenly awakened?

When he thought of that, he promptly inhaled a large breath and submerged himself in the pond; not resurfacing for awhile.

Although there were many things for him to complete, Kai Yang still went to take a shower. After dressing himself, he began his sweeping.

Afterall, this was his assigned work in Sky Tower. And since he was assigned this job, he must complete it to the best of his ability.

While sweeping, Kai Yang clearly felt that the gazes from his fellow disciples were strange. They were full of doubt, for they were the ones who had witnessed his battler earlier in the morning. They didn’t understand why Kai Yang had been able to knock Zhou Hu unconscious.

Kai Yang calmly and honestly continued with his work.

Completing his sweeping, Kai Yang returned to his wooden hut and opened his bag. From within, he took out the herbs he had collected, keeping the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass out and placing the other extra herbs back into the bag.

These extra herbs were completely useless to Kai Yang, but he can sell them to the Contribution Hall for some contribution points.

Wrapping up the herbs he started to leave before stopping. Thinking again, he went back and changed his clothes, wearing his tattered, bloodstained ones he also dirtied his face bit before leaving again.

In the Contribution Hall, Treasurer Meng was sitting behind the counter while holding a teapot. Crossing his legs while sipping the tea he merrily hummed a tuned.

Suddenly a human figure could be seen at the hall entrance. Old man Meng boredly lifted up his head to see, and just as he was about to scold that brat which dared to come here his eyes widened. So early in the morning and someone dared to disturb his peace and quiet. Yet when he saw Kai Yang battered and exhausted walking in. His tattered clothes which could no longer be considered clothes, his two legs were clearly seen, and so were his leg hairs.

(TL: Yea, I’m confused as you are, leg hairs......O.o)

The two female disciples at the entrance saw this and shrieked out in shock at this vagabond, quickly retreating.

How was Treasurer Meng’s self control? After entering the mountain, then descending into the seas, he would remain impassive. Even if there was a massacre of ten cities. Yet at that moment, he sprayed out his mouthful of tea; you could imagine the scene.

“Little Kai Yang, what is with your appearance?” Old man Meng nearly went into a frenzy, quickly standing up. Dumbstruck, he looked at Kai Yang.

Rushing to the counter, Kai Yang then inhaled a large gulp of air before replying: “I have returned!”

“Experienced many hardships right?” Treasurer Meng felt pity for Kai Yang. Just a few days ago when he had come to his place, he was still healthy, yet from a single trip to Black Wind Mountains, he had become like this. He was not like a human or even a ghost, this was too tragic.

“En, I was in danger.” Nodding his head, Kai Yang didn’t waste anymore words. Hurriedly he opened up his bag and pointed to the herbs inside: “But my harvest was not bad, Treasurer Meng, will the Contribution Hall accept these herbs?”

Looking at the herbs, Treasurer Meng’s eyebrows rose.

They were only ordinary grade lower level herbs, and practically had no worth. These herbs were too plentiful in the Contribution hall, even if he accepted, there would be no place to put them.

Just as he was about to reject the herbs, Treasurer Meng saw the expectation in Kai Yang’s eyes and then looked again at his attire. Seeing this his hearten softened: “Oh, we will accept. For every two herbs I will give you one contribution point.”

“Okay, then please count them.” Without bargaining, Kai Yang pushed the bag forward.

Treasurer Meng went to count the number of herbs. There were thirty-two herbs, a total of sixteen contribution points. Immediately he went to record this into his account book.

“You were in Black Wind Mountains for an entire three days, yet you only found this much?” Treasurer Meng causally asked.

“Being able to obtain this is considered good.” Kai Yang said while carefully looking around.

“Keke, it’s not bad.” Treasurer Meng couldn’t bear to pour cold water on Kai Yang, after all he knew of the difficulties he faced. Although this child’s natural aptitude was not good, he was willing to work hard. Nowadays, these types of hardworking youngsters are a rare sight. It’s such a shame, his aptitude was so poor that it was a fatal downside, for it destined him to have no major achievements.

As he was thinking about this, he saw how Kai Yang’s eyes were darting around and couldn’t help but ask he curiously: “What are you looking at?”

Mysteriously, Ki Yang leaned forward and said in a low voice: “Treasurer Meng, in this trip to the mountain I seem to have found some incredible thing.”

Seeing Kai Yang’s cautiousness, Treasurer Meng also felt that this thing was something uncommon. He also became more serious and said in a low voice: “What thing?”

“I don’t know. I have brought it back to let you see it. You are experienced and knowledgeable, so you should definitely be able to recognise it.” As he said this, he went to touch his butt and took out a another bag. Carefully he placed it on the counter.

Treasurer Meng looked up and saw Kai Yang’s face held both anticipation and nervousness. He couldn’t help but become cautious too. Softly and gently he opened the bag, squinting his eyes at the contents inside.

It was about the size of a bowl, dark-red coloured, shaped like a mushroom, like a fungus. It really looked unordinary, with a heaven and earthly type aura.

“Ke.......keke........” Treasurer Meng couldn’t help but cough a couple of times.

Nervously Kai Yang looked at him and questioned him: “What thing is this?”

Treasurer Meng looked at him queerly, and instead of replying, he asked: “Where did you find this?”

“Inside a cave in the mountain. There was also a first realm demonic beast guarding it. But instead of me being killed by it, it was killed by me, so I took it with me.”

Treasurer Meng’s heart jumped out: “You met with a demonic beast? Didn’t I tell you not to go past the safety boundary?”

“I didn’t go past the safety boundary. I didn’t know why it was in the safe zone area around Black Wind Mountain either.” Kai Yang replied in grievance.

Treasurer Meng sighed, he had thought something like this must have happened. It was just he was afraid that with this child’s strength, defeating a demonic beast, even one at the first realm must have been a very arduous task.

This pitiful one, at such a young age he has already suffered so many untold hardships while in Black Wind Mountains for only three days. And this work had only earned him sixteen contribution points. He even met with a first realm demonic beast, an encounter in which he nearly lost his life. If he was to tell him that his thing was, this things was.......ah this is too wrong, too wrong.

Anyway, this old man rarely does a good deed, just think of it as karma.

When Kai Yang saw Treasurer Meng’s face changing, yet Treasurer Meng not replying, it made him somewhat anxious. Just as he was about to ask him again, Treasurer Meng picked up the teapot and drank from it. Afterwards, he squeezed out a smile and said: “You little brat, your luck isn’t bad!”

As soon as he heard this, the worry in Kai Yang’s heart immediately dissipated. He was worried that when he went to ask, this thing would end up being worthless, that would have been embarrassing.

“Treasurer, what is this exactly? How many contribution points is it worth?” Rubbing his hands together in expectation Kai Yang asked.

“Oh.........this thing is called a blood mushroom! It is a rare medicinal ingredient, it is an ordinary........” Before he finished what he was saying, he looked at Kai Yang’s falling face and hurriedly went to correct himself. “No no no, it’s an earth grade lower level herb. En, it’s really earth grade lower level! That’s right!”

Such a firm tone was used that Treasurer Meng nearly fooled himself into thinking that it was true.

“Earth grade lower level?” Kai Yang was pleasantly surprised: “Treasurer Meng are you sure you didn’t see incorrectly?”

Straightening his face, Treasurer Meng replied: “You must be joking. In this old man’s life, he has inspected many women.....keke, inspected many herbs. This pair of experienced and knowledgeable eyes, how could they possibly be wrong?”

“How many contribution points can it be exchanged for?” Kai Yang was only interested in this.

“Let’s make it twenty.”

“That’s so little.” Kai Yang was somewhat disappointed. Even though its ranks wasn’t that high, he thought it was at least high enough to make it worth at least twenty to forty contribution points.

“It’s not too little child.” Treasurer thought to himself that he had given him too much already. He then found a good reason for this: “Even though this blood mushroom that you found is an earth grade lower level herb, it is too small and its age isn’t that high. So that’s why it’s only worth twenty contribution points.”

“Oh.” Without refuting he accepted: “Then twenty points it is.”

Nodding his head, Treasurer Meng recorded down the transaction down in his account book again.

This trip to the mountains had already satisfied his goal of obtaining the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Apart from that, it had earned him thirty-six contribution points. If he added his already obtained points, then he has a total of forty-eight contribution points. Kai Yang momentarily felt himself become rich and powerful.

Although this trip into the mountains earned him quite the contribution points from the herbs, it had delayed and wasted precious time to cultivate. He had also needed luck to find the herbs and the whole trip had made him very tired. Kai Yang decided that other than as a last resort, he wouldn’t do it again.

(ED: How did it waste time to cultivate... he only needs to do it for 30 mins in the morning and he managed that just fine in the mountains.....)

The reason why he was collecting contribution points, was to aid him in his cultivation. Between these two things, contribution points and cultivation, Kai Yang still knew which was more important; he didn’t lose sight due to greed.

Now he has collected a decent amount of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower. He had collected around thirty-forty of them in the cave, however the amount of Dead Jedi Tree Grass he had managed to collect was very small. He only had around five-six of them. If he really wanted to cultivate with them, then he must exchange some points for them at the Contribution Hall; he was well prepared for this.

With his plan in mind, Kai Yang said: “Treasurer Meng, please give me ten Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs.”

Old man Meng looked at Kai Yang and wondered why he needed these herbs, however he didn’t ask any questions. He only sat and stated: “Ten ordinary grade lower level herbs, ten contribution points. Are you sure you want them?”

Scrunching up his eyebrows in suspicion, Kai Yang asked: “That’s not right. Didn’t you just say two herbs needed to be exchanged for one contribution point?”

“The buying price is the buying price, while the selling price is the selling price. They are not the same.” Treasurer Meng smile was especially wide, the demeanor of a businessman was coming out.

Furious, Kai Yang pointed towards Treasurer Meng’s nose: “You are completely trying to buy at a low price and earn a profit. To reap a profit, this is too shameless. Did you let a dog eat your conscience?”

Waving his hand old man Meng replied: “It is not I who wants to reap a profit, but these are the prices assigned by the Main Gate. This is unrelated to me. All the prices within the Contribution Hall are unaffiliated with me, this old man is only in charge of selling and buying. How else do you think the Main Gate is able to provide for all three thousand of you disciples?”

Kai Yang was stunned, for there was some sense in his words. Afterall this was a business, without any type of profit by Sky Tower, how could all three thousand disciples in the Main Gate survive? Even if there one were suspicious that it was for a profit, at the end of the day, no one was forcing you to buy them. No one was forcing you.

“Then, do you still want the Dead Jedi Tree Grass herbs?” Seeing Kai Yang’s face full of pain caused Treasurer Meng’s mood to soar.

“I want them.” declared Kay Yang, as he clenched his teeth together. Sooner or later he will need to use these herbs and since he had decided not to go find them in the mountain, he can only buy them.

Turning around, Treasurer Meng went to the back hall and soon returned with the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Kai Yang counted the number of herbs while Treasurer Meng recorded the transaction down.

“Humph!” After eating such a big loss, Kai Yang turned around and immediately left the hall unhappy.

“Please come again when you have time.” Treasurer Meng called out warmly from behind.

Come often to be killed by you. Kai Yang finally knew where Meng’s nickname came from.

Three steps, two steps, Kai Yang frantically rushed outside. On his way out, a figure rushing outside nearly crashed into him.

These two people’s reactions were fairly fast, Kai Yang stopped immediately and so did the other person. A sweet and pleasant fragrance drifted over to Kai Yang.

Lifting his head, Kai Yang saw a pair of clear moon-like eyes staring at him, but he couldn’t see her face clearly. This was because this person had their face covered with a veil.

This was a female. Although he couldn’t see her face, judging from her skin’s condition, she wasn’t very old. She was probably his senior.

Nodding his head and apologising, Kai Yang then turned his body to the side; clearly signalling for her to enter first.

The opposite party looked distracted and suddenly turned red. Seeing this made his own gaze become evasive.

Seeing her flushed face, Kai Yang thought that this senior was quite shy. Swiftly he averted his gaze, as to avoid offending her.

Xia Ning Chang was embarrassed to death.

She didn’t expect to bump into Kai Yang in front of the Contribution Hall. When she saw his face, she immediately thought of her......

And recalled his........

Suddenly her face became red and her temperature rose. Hastily she rushed into the hall, she didn’t even dare to lift her head up.

Seeing this scene was somewhat laughable, for such shy females were quite rare. Although there are many females disciples in Sky Tower, they were martial practitioners and were therefore more open-minded than normal. For someone like her to become red just from looking at his face, it was no wonder she wore a veil.

This senior was a little bit cute, it was just why was her body’s fragrance vaguely familiar, like he had already smelled it before?

After she entered the Contribution Hall, Xia Ning Chang glanced back. When she saw that Kai Yang had already left, she let out a sigh of relief, for she still felt a little bit guilty due to the morning’s incident.

While her feelings were in a mess, she heard Treasurer Meng let out an ai~o sigh from the counter.

“What’s the matter master?” Xia Ning Chang asked.

“You were just pitying that child.” Treasurer Meng sighed out sobbingly. “He’s a good child; willing to endure hardships, he’s hardy, has a good personality, his character’s not bad.......”

When Xia Ning Chang heard the way her master was praising Kai Yang, she immediately grew angry. In her heart she thought that he had yet to learn of Kai Yang’s actions this morning. Not only had he striped naked, he had also sullied this disciple’s eyes and given this disciple of yours the fright of her life.

On and on Treasurer Meng went, causing her to be more and more infuriated. Unable to bear it any longer, she slapped her hand onto the counter.

“Pa!” The sounded resounded like something had been broken.

As he looked at her, his face contorted and he wailed out: “That was my earth grade lower level blood mushroom worth twenty contribution points...”

“This was a blood mushroom?” Looking at the already powdered mushroom on the counter top, Xia Ning Chang asked herself whether or not her master’s eyes were failing. How is this a blood mushroom?

“It’s not, it’s not. How could your master mistake it.” Treasurer Meng replied as he let out a soft breath. The powder on the countertop then floated outside, like an invisible hand had scooped it up and scattered in the wind.

“Oh that’s right. Why did you come to find me today?” Fixing his face, Treasurer Meng showed a rare face of solemnity.

“I broke through.”

His expression changing, he went to inspect Xia Ning Chang’s cultivation. Soon after he nodded: “Good, good. It seems like I didn’t see incorrectly, for only people of your physique are suited to this cultivation method. Come, eat this pellet to help stabilize your cultivation.”

“En.” After she took the pellet, Xia Ning Chang hesitated slightly before asking: “How is your injury?”

Laughing softly Treasurer Meng answered: “You don’t need to worry about your master. After so many years, there is not big hinderance.”

Brimming with anticipation and excitement, Kai Yang returned home to his small hut.

Today the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass were all gathered and ready to be used. The amount of each was also not small, so it should last awhile.

Now he had everything prepared, Kai Yang really wanted to verify, whether or not that incense burner could truly aid him in his cultivation.

The location of the wooden hut was in the most empty and desolate area of Sky Tower, practically no one paid any attention to it. Since this was the case, Kai Yang didn’t worry about having his secret exposed. Walking inside, he called out the black book and turned to page three. Then he extracted the incense burner and placed it on the bedside.

He then took out the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass. Afterwards he stuffed them into the burner and put the lid back on.

All of a sudden a faint scent, akin to a rare perfume started to disperse in the room. Breathing in deeply, Kai Yang began to analyse the perfume. Although the smell was a bit unique, there was nothing special about it.

However, from the holes of the incense burner, the perfume steadily poured out and entered Kai Yang’s nostrils. It was like small, snakes were purposely entering his body via his nose.

Within his body, it was like there was something more. In his flesh and blood, in his meridians and even in his bone marrow a feeling of numbness spread.

Kai Yang didn’t dare tarry. Carrying the incense burner, he ran outside to begin his cultivation.

Stepping out of his hut entrance into the light took him by surprise. For his foot felt like it was made of lead, it was far heavier than normal. In combination with this step, Kai Yang felt his strength rapidly decreasing.

Taking another step, he began to feel dizzy and wanted to collapse; perspiring madly, his muscles tensed. The recently cultivated atmospheric energy in his meridians bubbled about and his bones cracked.

Taking his third step out of his hut, his legs became soft and he fell to the ground. As he fell, Kai Yang’s hands let go of the incense burner and it rolled far away.

Hands on the floor supporting his body; immovable like a mountain, he gasped for breath. His chest heaved up and down as he took several deep breaths, his body continued twitched uncontrollably. His tendons, organs and bones expanded and contracted causing the pain to intensify as time past. Although Kai Yang wanted to howl in pain, he kept his mouth tightly shut.

His current condition was one of excessive exhaustion; one he had experienced many times previously. Thus Kai Yang was quite familiar with it.

But, he had only walked three steps out of his hut, so how did he exhaust all his energy? Not only was his physical stamina gone, his mental strength was also exhausted. It was like he had not slept for many nights, even his eyes had started to feel drowsy.

At this point, his three energies were all exhausted to the limit, and he couldn’t even move a single finger.

By this time, the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass’s side effects had started to take effect in Kai Yang’s brain.

The toxicity of these two herbs wasn’t very strong. They were weak enough that normal people could resist them easily, but the prerequisite was that they were healthy. Given the hardships Kai Yang suffered daily combined with his current condition, Kai Yang had trouble withstanding them.

He was afraid that inhaling the incense burner’s perfume was the reason this type of situation had occurred. Though, regardless of the toxicity of the Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass, such strong side effects was something they were unable to produce. The mystery originated from the incense burner; it was able to amplify those two herb’s toxicity.

Ever since he had obtained the golden body, every time he practised he never became tired or exhausted. And since he was never tired, Kai Yang was unable to reach his limits. Being unable to reach his limits, he was unable to improve.

Though it appeared this was no longer the case anymore. He only took three steps, yet his all his strength had been consumed. But the effect of this incense burner was not as simple as enabling him to reach his limits at this stage, for in the future will there ever be any fear he wouldn’t able to train to his limits again?

Kai Yang always believed that a person’s potential was unlimited, and the important thing was how one uncovered it. Although natural aptitude could help a person mature, one’s own effort was crucial! So after all these years, even he knew his own talent was lacking, he diligently struggled and never gave up his drive to cultivate.

Thinking this, Kai Yang’s spirits were greatly lifted!

Gradually and with much effort, he used his hand to push his exhausted body up; his thighs strained so much that his veins popped out. Gritting his teeth, he slowly pulled himself up.

Almost all of his physical strength had been drained, his consciousness had started to become fuzzy once again. Yet his heart refused to give in, giving him a ferocious burst of strength and energy. In his entire life, he had never been this adamant about anything, he was adamant he would beat this!

Stand up! For the place you fall, will also be the place from which you rise! If he stood up he would have broken through his limits, he would have won!

Time had never flowed as slowly as it did now, both his feet had already been planted firmly on the ground. Legs slightly bent, fighting against the trembling, his desire to stand had not diminished in the slightest, he would do it even if it meant taking it as slow as possible.

Finally Kai Yang bellowed/roared out, for he had finally stood up straight. Staggering forward, he steadied himself and anchored his feet to the ground.

Kai Yang smiled at that moment. It seemed odd, after all both his physical and mental strength were exhausted and he could no longer see clearly. His ears were ringing and his head was throbbing very badly, yet he still laughed.

‘I won! The sense of achievement that I feel right now is vastly greater than when I won against another person!‘

Just when Kai Yang felt that he was going to faint, a warm feeling burst out from within his body. This warm feeling came from within his bones, like a spring rain that replenishes the fields after a drought, it blew through every part of his body. Through every inch of flesh, bringing with it a burst of vitality.

His exhausted strength was quickly replenished; even his mental energy was revitalized to a certain extent. Although his energy didn’t recover fully, it was enough to keep him from losing consciousness.

Kai Yang didn’t pause to revel in this feeling any further, but hurriedly sat down and analysed his current condition. This lead him to discover that the original numbing feeling from within his body had already disappeared without a trace. It left him with a comfortable feeling, it was so comfortable that it nearly made him cry out.

His body pulsed rhythmically, and along with this, it was clear that it had become more robust and contained more explosive power than before. The atmospheric energy within his meridian pulsated incessantly; his bones also seemed to have become a lot sturdier.

Just through this alone, his body had been strengthened by a large margin.

This made him contemplative.

Finally the last bit of warmth from his bones had seeped out; this was most likely from that golden body he had absorbed. After experiencing this several times already, Kai Yang had grasped the key information. Only when he had pushed his body to its limits, could he trigger the golden body’s hidden powers.

Though if he surrendered when he was in a predicament, that golden body would not give him any help.

This really was the golden body’s personality! Kai Yang chuckled lightly. Right now, he had finally understood how this incense burner could aid him in his training.

The herbs that were put into the burner, their effects were multiplied hundreds of folds in strength. Then when he inhaled this incense, it made his strength rapidly decrease and also made him mentally tired. So much so that he could only take three steps before nearly fainting.

Although these amplified herbal effects were tyrannical, they shouldn’t have any long term negative side effects thought Kai Yang. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to the incense burner to assist in his training.

But only when he overcomes his limits, and arouses the golden’s skeleton’s regenerative ability, will he be able to really benefit. Only then will he be able to constantly surpass his limit and grow stronger.

The perfume that wafted out from the incense burner, served him well; just like that golden skeleton.

Though these were all just assumptions on Kai Yang’s part. But given the previous events, he felt this should be the truth. Next up, Kai Yang needed to closely analyse the incense burner.

The perfume never ceased pouring out of the burner. Even when there was a gust of wind, the perfume would always float in Kai Yang’s direction.

He also discovered that if he stayed in the same spot and didn’t move, then the perfume didn’t have any effect.

After another half an hour or so, Kai Yang felt that most of his strength had recovered. Staggering he stood up, once again he began to take steps forward.

Since he had already been burned once, Kai Yang advanced slowly and cautiously monitored his body for the effects of the incense burner.

As soon as he put one foot down, Kai Yang discovered that his strength gushed out of him like a broken dam. His physical strength disappeared, and with it so did his mental energy; with no sign or reason.

As he took another step, what little strength he had remaining disappeared, causing him to nearly fall down.

Clenching his jaw tightly, Kai Yang’s stubborn attitude emerged again. Putting his life on the line, he advanced forward.

This time, he managed to take four steps. And although he was mentally unwilling to give up, his body could no longer take it. His strength wasn’t too bad.

The warm feeling once again poured out from within him, but it was not strong enough so he fainted again.

After repeating this process numerous times, all of his assumptions were confirmed.

Although the perfume that came from the incense burner caused people to become more worn out, it didn’t leave any negative side effects. While the golden skeleton on the other hand needed his will to fight, in order to be used. The stronger he felt about not yielding, the stronger the warmth it gave was and the more his body benefited.

This type of training method was truly monstrous so much so that it was unthinkable. Putting it simply, you were risking your life to increase your strength. If you were a little bit careless, then there would be drastic consequences. Luckily Kai Yang’s self-preservation sense was quite high. Everytime he broke through his limits, he would concede and rest before continuing. So after repeating the cycle many times, the results he reaped were bountiful.

A person’s potential, was truly unlimited. But in order to become stronger, you must do things step by step.

After an entire day of training, his improvement was very clear. He could already walk a full ten steps, a large improvement from his first attempt of just three.

But Kai Yang was still unsatisfied; even under the effects of the perfume, he was still only walking. Until the day he practised with his fists, this could not be considered training.

Quickly, Kai Yang found another disastrous problem.

This type of training used his herbs up far too quickly!

The Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and the Dead Jedi Tree Grass could only be burned for about an hour. After an hour, he must once again put in more herbs for the incense burner to continue to produce the perfume.

Using his hand to calculate the herb consumption, Kai Yang’s face immediately became ugly.

There were twelve hours in a day, he trained for about seven to eight hours a day. So that meant that he needed at least fourteen of these herbs, in order to practise under the effects of the incense burner for the a whole day. With his current store, he would use up all his Dead Jedi Tree Grass in two days, while also using about fifty percent of his stockpile of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower.

What would he do after he used up all his current herb stock? He only had thirty eight contribution points. How many days would that last him?

Originally he had thought he was quite rich, but reality struck him hard and showed him how poor he really was.

That night, he carried his worries to bed, his head full of contribution points and herbs. Even in his dreams, he dreamt of mining large amounts of Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower and Dead Jedi Tree Grass.

That night, Kai Yang didn’t sleep very well at all.

That night, Su Mu didn’t sleep very well either.

Thinking about how, overbearingly he had brought people over to cause trouble for Kai Yang, but had instead lost against him. This made Su Mu toss and turn restlessly in his bed. If it wasn’t for Kai Yang, then he would be happily engaged with Boss He’s daughter. If it wasn’t for Kai Yang, then he wouldn’t be here with a stomach full of resentment.

As he recalled the He family’s daughter’s vivid appearance, Su Mu’s heart fell into depression. In the future, he will no longer have the face to go and interact with her. As the saying went: ‘You would rather destroy ten temples, than destroy one marriage.’ Kai Yang, you dared to destroy a happy couple, you are too daring.

As another saying went: ‘For a nobleman to take revenge, ten years is not long at all.’ An insignificant person however, can go for revenge all day long.

Su Mu would definitely be classified as the latter, for after a few more days, he could once again challenge Kai Yang. But how could Su Mu wait until then? Su Mu wanted to go to Kai Yang immediately and beat him to a bloody pulp. Only then would it sate his inner hatred and resentment.

Tossing and turning, he couldn’t fall asleep such was his fury, so Su Mu got up. Not only did he get up in the middle of the night, he also made his underlings wake up too.

Not long after, a group of sleepy eyed Sky Tower disciples had gathered.

“Young master Su, is there anything you need?” Someone asked while rubbing their eyes.

“It’s nothing much, it’s only about the affair this morning.” Su Mu tried his hardest to calm down his heart: “The reason why I have gathered you all here is because I want you to help me come up with some ideas that will help me get revenge and pacify my hatred.”

Someone said: “Young Master Su, why don’t you just wait four days. In four days, you can go challenge Kai Yang, and you will definitely be able to beat him to pieces.”

Annoyed, Su Mu replied: “If I really wanted to wait until then, then why did I call you all over?”

The sleepy people who had been gathered, were suddenly startled into standing up. Evidently, they weren’t very awake, so nobody had paid attention to Su Mu’s words and only yawned widely. When he saw their reactions, Su Mu became vexed. Slapping the table he shouted: “All of you, help me think of some good ideas. If you guys can’t help me think of some good ideas, none of you can think about going back to sleep!”

This startled everyone, and they realised that Su Mu was actually angry. His slap and loud voice had caused them to fully regain consciousness and they hurriedly put their minds to use, thinking up some good strategies.

Not long after a disciple named Li Yun Tian eyes widened from formulating a good plan. Opening his mouth, he told Su Mu: “Young Master, we could do this......”

As he said this, he crept closer to give a detailed explanation of his plan. How could they, how could they, how could they, able to, able to, able to.

Su Mu’s heart burst with joy, he hit Li Yun Tian’s back in excitement while saying: “Not bad. Not Bad. This is a good plan, so I will leave it to you to complete the task!”

“Leave it to me young master Su!” Li Yun Tian was also smiling widely.

“You can all go back to sleep.” Su Mu waved his hands as he said this and everybody relaxed themselves before promptly leaving to go back to their beds.

Looking out at the pitch black darkness outside his room, Su Mu laughed evilly. “Kai Yang, Brother Kai, let us wait and see at dawn!”

Finally, with his heart content, Su Mu fell asleep.

The next day, Kai Yang woke up to practise the tempered body record before going out to do some sweeping.

Yesterday, when he used the incense burner to help practise, although he was constantly on the brink of death; so much so that even now his whole body ached; the results were really evident. This was most obvious when he was practising the tempered body fist, because he felt that the pressure he felt was slightly smaller. He had also understood that the pressure given from the incense burner was similar to the pressure he felt when practising the tempered body record. As long as he adapted to one type of pressure, he would naturally be able to adapt to another type.

This incense burner was a good thing! His spirits high, Kai Yang wanted to quickly finish his work and go back to train.

Just as Kai Yang was halfway through his sweeping, someone had suddenly blocked his path. Looking up, he thought that person looked vaguely familiar. When he was thinking this, that person opened their mouth and laughed loudly.

(ED: It’s here guys, Ning makes her reappearance. Prepare yourselves for more risque leg action, three quarter length pants incoming. Just kidding.)

Last night Li Yun Tian had suggested a plan to Su Mu. Though he had everything planned, he didn’t dare be careless, for he knew it would not be easy. He must not let the opposite party become suspicious and must first trick him; to make him exchange some moves with him.

Yesterday when he had accompanied Su Mu to challenge Kai Yang, he had hidden himself at the rear of the crowd. He also didn’t say much, so Kai Yang shouldn’t be able to recognise him, making things much easier.

Since earlier he had been waiting for Kai Yang to come past this area during his daily sweep. His waiting had finally paid off, Kai Yang had come here to sweep. Putting on a big and friendly smile :D, and a innocent and harmless demeanor, Li Yun Tian walked over.

His current expression should be friendly enough! Li Yun Tian told himself to boost his confidence.

“Does this fellow disciple have any problems?” However Kai Yang was not courteous, since any disciple here currently should be his junior. It was early into the entry period, so their levels shouldn’t be that high, so many would claim to be fellow disciples.

“Are you not senior disciple Kai Yang?” Li Yun Tian asked as if he knew the answer already.

Kai Yang nodded his head: “Yes.”

Breathing in deeply, Li Yun Tian said: “So it really is you! Senior Kai, I have been looking forward to meeting with you. Now that I have met you today, I can see you really live up to expectations!”

(TL: Arse-kisser)

These words had made even Li Yun Tian himself want to vomit, but he must maintain the facade and act like his words were sincere.

“This is serious, this is serious.” Kai Yang’s name was already loudly proclaimed by this junior.

Li Yun Tian put up quite a performance. Taking Kai Yang’s hand, he said admiringly: “Senior Kai, I heard you had taught Zhou Hu a harsh lesson yesterday. You really a person with a big heart.”

“What, you have enmity with him?” asked Kai Yang while sizing him up.

Li Yun Tian’s face turned cold: “Yes I do. That person is like a beast, despicable; he even humiliated me once.”

“But you didn’t go get revenge.” Kai Yang noted.

“I even dream about getting revenge, but......” Sighing loudly he replied: “Senior Kai, I’m afraid you also know this, Zhou Hu has somebody supporting him. I wouldn’t pay attention to an insignificant person like Zhou Hu, but the person behind is someone I can’t easily provoke. ”

“That’s true.” Kai Yang nodded his head, after all, Su Mu had some powerful people backing him. So an ordinary disciple obviously wouldn’t dare provoke him.

“That’s why yesterday, when senior Kai gave Zhou Hu a lesson, you helped this junior get his revenge.” Li Yun Tian said gratefully, tears flowing down his face.

Laughing, Kai Yang replied: “We were only exchanging some pointers, it wasn’t anything.”

Li Yun Tian pressed ahead: “Senior Kai, since you were able to win against Zhou Hu, your strength shouldn’t be that weak.”

Waving his hand Kai Yang replied: “It’s not much, it isn’t something so amazing.”

Li Yun Tian was sneering inside, you finally said something true. If you didn’t plan something yesterday, then how could Zhou Hu possibly lose to you? But he didn’t dare reveal his true thoughts, in case Kai Yang became suspicious. That would be disastrous for his plan.

“Senior you are too modest. Come, come, come, normally I, Li Yun Tian don’t have the opportunity to exchange pointers with anybody. Senior Kai, you have done so much for me and since we happened to meet up today we must not miss this chance. Please spar with me.” After going around in circles, Li Yun Tian finally found an opportunity to ask the question that was the true reason he had talked to Kai Yang.

Forcing a smile, Kai Yang asked: “You want to compare notes with me?”

Li Yun Tian nodded his head enthusiastically: “Of course. I hope senior will not be stingy, and allow this junior to see how senior defeated Zhou Hu. And to help me also.”

This reason was really a bit hard to believe, shaking his head Kai Yang rejected the request: “Forget it. You don’t usually fight others anyway.”

Li Yun Tian anxiously pressured him: “That won’t do, senior you will agree even if you don’t want to.”

Laughing, Kai Yang looked at him and laughed coldly.

Li Yun Tian’s heart jumped out. He was a bit impatient just then and was too rushed and forceful with his words, he immediately started laughing too: “Junior is really too weak. So if senior were to give some pointers, it would be very helpful.”

“No can do.” Kai Yang refused.

“Why?”

“There is no reason to.....”

Seeing that Kai Yang was intentionally moving away from him now, Li Yun Tian called out: “Exchanging some notes, naturally we could help other greatly. Isn’t that reason enough? If we exchanged pointers, it will benefit both of us.”

“You can put it like that, but.....no. No, no.” Repeatedly Kai Yang waved his hand.

“Don’t be like that senior, exchanging some pointers will not make you pregnant.” Li Yun Tian’s face was full of anxiety, he didn’t even dare reveal his true intentions. Heart thumping, he quickly thought up an idea: “Could it be that senior is afraid that he will lose and his contribution points will be deducted, am I right?”

Chapter 28 - Too petty

Facing Li Yun Tian’s inquiry, Kai Yang had no response.

Thinking that he had guessed correctly, Li Yun TIan smiled widely: “Don’t worry senior. Our strengths should be about the same, so it’s not certain as to who will and who will lose. And if by chance, this junior wins and senior loses, then your losses will be covered by me.”

“Are you serious?” enquired Kai Yang, this was a rather unexpected.

“A nobleman’s word is his bond!” Li Yun Tian bellowed loudly.

Originally he thought that he had successfully tricked Kai Yang, and had assumed his battle stance. He knew that Su Mu was hidden somewhere in the surrounding area, so if he was able to teach Kai Yang a good lesson, then he would be able to greatly increase his face.

But Kai Yang just wrinkled his brows, nearly causing Li Yun Tian to stamp foot and curse his mother. This senior, is too ** annoying and like a bitch. How could Zhou Hu lose to this type of person?

“Senior, do you have any other questions?” Li Yun Tian was on the verge of exploding in frustration.

“Oh, although I would like to trade notes with you, regrettably I am unable to as I was already challenged by someone yesterday. If you really wanted to exchange pointers, then you must wait a few more days.”

Bull! Li Yun Tian almost couldn’t breathe, hastily he said: “Senior, you can challenge me since I haven’t been challenged these past few days. Don’t all Sky Tower disciples have the chance to challenge someone every few days?”

“It was like this!” Just realising this now, Kai Yang laughed out loud: “Junior brother, these past few years, it has always been me who was challenged thus I had completely forgotten this rule.”

Slowly breathing out, Li Yun Tian really wanted to spit out all the rage and anger inside of him. After a while he inquired: “Senior, now can we compare some notes?”

Kai Yang still had another question: “Junior, if I really lost, would you really pay me contribution points?”

“I will! I will definitely pay you and not only that, I will pay you ten times the amount!” He said, grinding his teeth together.

Shaking his head, Kai Yang replied: “I don’t believe you. Unless you first pay me the contribution points I won’t believe you.”

“How can I give them to you?” Li Yun Tian replied gloomily, for contribution points were recorded down by a third party in an account book. It wasn’t something you could just carry around to give to others. How was he, a senior, so narrow minded. Did he believe that he wouldn’t stick to his word?

“I do have an alternative.” Smiling cryptically at Li Yun Tian, Kai Yang beckoned him closer and whispered into his ear.

Li Yun Tian’s face changed into several shades of different colours and he couldn’t help but admit that this Kai Yang’s mind was really shrewd. He could actually think of this type of solution.

“Junior, if you feel that this is impossible then it’s okay. It’s not because this senior cannot trust you, it’s just......” Playing hard to get, Kai Yang hesitated to voice his next words.

LI Yun Tian didn’t know what he wanted, but in order for his own plan to succeed he must give in. So he asked: “It won’t hurt, so senior please wait. Wait until I have retrieved the item. My speed is very fast.”

As he was saying this, he was already speeding away.

Looking at his receding back, Kai Yang sighed out in pity; to think there were still people in this world that were willing to offer themselves up to get beaten. With his request refused, he then went to retrieve something, he was really strange. Thankfully it temporarily achieved his needs. It was just that this method could only be used once, next time he would no longer be able to use it.

After thinking for a while, Kai Yang mentally bashed himself. When he remembered the junior’s desperateness, no matter what he requested he would have agreed.

Su Mu, along with a bunch of other people were hidden too far from Kai Yang. Originally when he saw that Li Yun Tian and Kai Yang had started to talk, his heart was jumping circles. Just as he was settling down to enjoy a good show, Li Yun Tian hastily ran away, causing Su Mu to be confused.

Yesterday when they were discussing the plan, this wasn’t included! What was this Li Yun Tian up to?

His heart full of doubt, Su Mu immediately ordered someone to intercept Li Yun Tian and inquire about the situation.

After fifteen minutes, that person had returned and whispered to him: “Young master Su, Li Yun Tian said that Kai Yang is narrowed minded and had told him to first go to the Contribution Hall to retrieve some herbs to compensate him. Only then would he agree to compare notes.”

“Aren’t you a bit too petty?” Su Mu said flabbergastedly: “Kai Yang is only a trial disciple, so if he lost, he would only lose one contribution point. So, why would he need to compensate him ten herbs?”

That person answer: “Li Yun Tian caused this, he said that he would compensate him ten times the amount, so.........”

“Eh, no wonder.” Su Mu’s face became slightly ugly, “But forget about it. As long as that Kai Yang can receive this lesson, ten herbs aren’t that much.”

Ten herbs cost about ten contribution points. Such a small amount of points weren’t put into the eyes of Su Mu.

Since everyone now knew the entire situation, they could only patiently await the battle.

Half an hour passed and Kai Yang was nearly finished with his sweeping. Shortly thereafter, Kai Yang saw a red and tired face, it was Li Yun Tian running closer. Li Yun Tian didn’t blame the fact that the distance of the Contribution was too large, but rather that Treasurer Meng who was still still asleep for causing him to take so long. After a long time of shouting and banging on the door, had he woken up.

Since old man Meng was disturbed from his sweet dream, his temper was short. Without even allowing old man Meng the time to teach him a lesson, Li Yun Tian quickly purchased ten ordinary grade lower level herbs. This cost him about twenty contribution points.

The anger Li Yun Tian held! He was determined to earn the interest back from Kai Yang’s body.

Returning, he saw that Kai Yang hadn’t left. He stood there, with his broom in his hand waiting for him.

Three steps, two steps, as Li Yun Tian gasped for breath, he rushed over to Kai Yang. Taking out the herbs, he breathlessly said: “Here, check it senior.”

“Hehe, no need.” Acting as if he was very big hearted, Kai Yang took the herbs without counting and placed them, along with his broom onto the ground.

“Senior, now can we compare notes?” Li Yun Tian asked.

“We can, we can. Actually, junior didn’t have to go to such lengths. IF you had asked, this senior would have readily agreed.” Kai Yang smiled cheerfully.

Li Yun Tian was nearly angered to the point of meeting buddha, two buddhas in heaven, three in nirvana and four living together. It was you who wanted the herbs, it was you who didn’t trust me, and it was you who made me travel such a distance. Could it be that this whole journey was unnecessary?

But he will forget about it he decided, and chose to take some deep breaths to calm down his mind. For today, once this battle started, he would thoroughly teach Kai Yang a good lesson.

“Junior, shall we start?” Kai Yang queried Li Yun Tian’s opinion.

“Okay.” His spirited roused, Li Yun Tian replied and cupped his hands. “Please give me some teachings senior!”

“Don’t dare, don’t dare!” Kai Yang humbly smiled.

Neither dared or wanted to reveal their current cultivation levels. Li Yun Tian was afraid that it would scare Kai Yang away, while Kai Yang wanted to keep it a secret. With each thinking of their own reasons in their respective minds, the battle started.

Seeing Zhou Hu’s mistake yesterday and his heart full of hatred, how could Li Yu Tian possibly be merciful? He thought as he prepared to use thunder to knock down this senior.

With the lightning fast exchanges, the air around became charged with tension. Dodging each other’s attacks, Kai Yang and Li Yun Tian had already exchanged fists. Since Li Yun Tian’s heart was full of hatred, his fists didn’t contain any real power. But within his flurry of fists, each was faster than the last and more profound.

Kai Yang didn’t panic but remained calm. The practise that he had been doing these past few days started to show their results. With only the Sky Tower’s basic skills and the kicks, he fought.

After a few exchanges, Li Yun Tian became fearful. His opponent exuded a vigourous energy, which left him unstable and pushed him back a few steps. Not only that, each punch that he threw out made him feel like he hit a boulder and left his whole hand numb.

Chapter 29 - A big loss

After suffering a loss, Li Yun Tian didn’t dare to be carelessly anymore. Intensely looking at Kai Yang, he flitted about before executing a couple of swift punches towards Kai Yang.

That’s for being narrow-minded, that’s for making me run to the Contribution Hall so early in the morning, he grumbled inside while attacking. ‘Peng, peng’ resounded every time Li Yun Tian struck out. Nearby, Su Mu was stunned as each fist landed on Kai Yang, while Li Yun Tian felt pain with each fist.

Both people were tempered body cultivators, but since their levels weren’t very high, the amount of blows they exchanged were small. Furthermore, Kai Yang wanted to tests out his body’s condition, so he allowed Li Yun Tian to land his attacks on his body.

Within the time it took to make some tea, Kai Yang came to understand his current body condition; it was stronger, far stronger than a few days ago. With his goal achieved, Kai Yang no longer wanted to be subjected to his junior’s nagging.

Just as victory was at hand for Li Yun Tian, something changed. The Senior Kai, who could only retreat and defend a few moment ago, face lit up in excitement. It was like when an evil spirit met a naked young lady. This sudden change in attitude caused Li Yun Tian to feel uneasy.

more closely, he noticed that Kai Yang’s excitement was different to what he had previously thought. It was a colder and bloodthirsty type of excitement.

With a bad feeling in his stomach, Li Yun Tian retreated, but one step from Kai Yang blocked his path, he was like a towering mountain.

Jumping up, Li Yun Tian wanted to escape from Kai Yang’s pursuit. Raising his leg, Kai Yang swept it towards Li Yun Tian’s waist.

A miserable cry leaked out of his mouth, while he flew a couple of feet. Without pausing, Kai Yang ruthlessly stepped down, stomped on him and a rain of fists followed.

A bloodcurdling scream echoed.

This round of ‘note comparing’ ended up with Li Yun Tian losing, begging for mercy.

When Li Yun Tian was sent flying earlier, he still had the intention to continue. But under the merciless barrage of Kai Yang’s punches, his injuries quickly increased.

After a while, Li Yun Tian could no longer endure it. Afterwards he noticed Kai Yang and his own reactions were completely different.

The more he hit Kai Yang , the more excited Kai Yang became. When he hit him, the more painful and sorrowful it became for Li Yun Tian.

Why would there be anyone who would be happy to get beaten? The more red, blood and flesh that Kai Yang saw, the happier he looked. It made him look slightly mad.

Li Yun Tian thought this person was mad. Yet after the end of the battle, Kai Yang returned to normal, back to his kind and amiable self. In fact, he even helped to pull him back up and smiled saying that he allowed him to win. Then he picked up his broom and left.

When he was in battle compared to when he was not in battle, he was two completely different people!

His body was sore all over, how could he not sustain some injuries from Kai Yang’s multiple fists.

This time, it really was a case of trying to steal the chicken but losing the rice to lure it, Li Yun Tian thought in tears.

He had already constantly refused to compare notes with Li Yun Tian, yet he had been adamant. He even spent twenty contribution points in exchange for ten herbs to secure the exchange. And the result.......he had lost. Not only were the herbs taken away from him, he will also be deducted contribution points.

This time, it really was a big loss! Was this not offending because of something petty? Li Yun Tian felt endless regret.

Su Mu and the others, watching from not too far away were also shocked stupid. When they saw Li Yun Tian and Kai Yang start, they were sorely tempted to jump out and started cheering; for he had finally succeed in getting Kai Yang to exchange pointers. Soon, Kai Yang was going to be beaten black and blue.

Su Mu even had it all planned out. When Kai Yang was beaten, he would go over and give a few extra words of ridicule. That way, he will be able to release some of his heart’s anger. But contrary to what they expected, when the battle started, Kai Yang had fought Li Yun Tian to a stand still.

For a while Su Mu thought the things that he saw were a little blurry. Suspiciously, he leaned over and asked: “What stage is Li Yun Tian again?”

“Tempered body seventh stage and has already started to cultivate train his own vitality. It’s just that the time he has trained it is too little, so it cannot be used well yet.”

“And Kai Yang?” Su Mu asked again.

“I think he is about the tempered body fourth stage?” His voice a bit uncertain.

Everyone was overwhelmed with shock, for despite a difference of three stages, he had managed to fight evenly with Li Yun Tian and that was too monstrous. No wonder yesterday Zhou Hu was defeated with only three moves. Even with such a large difference, Kai Yang had won. So even if Zhou Hu had used all his strength, he wouldn’t win.

But, how could that person, of all these speculations, be that powerful? If he really possessed this type of strength, why would he lose all his previous battles? Kai Yang had been a trial disciple for three years already, and year after he was admitted, he was constantly challenged. Every time, until yesterday, he hadn’t won a single one of his battles in these past two years.

The greatest shock that Su Mu and co. were to experience had yet to come. They had thought that Kai Yang being able to endure even one of Li Yun Tian’s strikes was nothing short of a miracle; there was no possible way for him to win. Yet, when Kai Yang really defeated Li Yun Tian, everybody was like a crow and peacock, making no sound. They couldn’t believe their own eyes.

A tempered body fourth stage practitioner beat a tempered body seventh stage practitioner. In the couple of hundred years of Sky Tower’s history, this type of situation had never happened before. Could it be that even a stinky salty fish will have a chance to turn over?

As he was standing there in a trance, Su Mu felt someone tap his shoulder gently. Turning around, he was greeted by Kai Yang smiling at him while carrying his broom. His face full of affection he said: “Junior Su, if there will be another good opportunity like this, please remember to notify me as well.”

“You already knew?” The corners of Su Mu’s mouth twitched.

Gently, Kai Yang chuckled: “Yesterday, although junior Li was hidden within the crowd, he was with you. The only good point of this senior is his memory.”

“How sly!” Su Mu hated him so much that he gnashed his teeth together vigorously. Only now, did he realise everybody had been thoroughly tricked by Kai Yang.

“We’re both in the same boat.” He laughed: “Oh right, I can still challenge someone tomorrow. Aren’t we all allowed to request anyone for a battle once everyday? Enjoy your day everybody and I will come find you tomorrow.”

Everyone’s face immediately became ice cold. Witnessing Kai Yang’s current actions, hadn’t he experienced the sweetness from this little action? Then when they looked at Li Yun Tian and thought how their own strengths were about the same level as Li Yun Tian, a shiver ran down their spines. Frightened they said: “Young master Su, what should we do now?”Su Mu was also at his wits end. After all, duels were a long time tradition of Sky Tower. Which disciple hasn’t been challenged before? Although he had someone backing him, he still didn’t dare to recklessly break the Main Gate rules.

“Relax, he probably said it to scare you. If he really came to challenge you, I will make sure that he won’t be able to walk.”

Hearing Su Mu say this, everyone felt more secure and relaxed.

Kai Yang had thought of this on the spot. All Sky Tower disciples had the opportunity to issue a challenge each day and since he had never used this privilege before, he naturally had forgotten about it. With today’s reminder from Li Yun Tian, he had remembered it.

One battle a day, however defeating an ordinary disciple could only earn him two contribution points, but mosquito meat is still meat. After accumulating them for a month, it would not be a small amount.

Besides, on the road of martial cultivation, you cannot close yourself off completely from the outside world. Battling these fellow disciples and exchanging some pointers, will not do any harm and it doesn’t take very long. Just treat it like a relaxation activity, you can even earn some contribution points while you relax. What harm is there?

Though, the harvest from today’s challenge was quite a good one. Not only did he earn two contribution points, he also gained ten strands of much needed Dead Jedi Tree Grass. This was such a profitable day.

If there was someone to give him ten herbs everyday, how good would that be! Kai Yang daydreamed a bit.

Returning to his wooden hut, Kai Yang immediately took out the incense burner and lit it. Breathing in the perfume, he started his arduous training.

Chapter 30 - The salty fish turns over

The next day, a whole group of disciples were gathered to practise. They talked and laughed together, although the work was very tiring, it was done in a festive manner. Suddenly, someone called out in a certain direction: “Young......young master Su.........”

“What?” Su Mu asked dubiously.

“He really came.”

“Who came?” Somewhat impatiently, Su Mu gazed over the in the direction the person was pointing towards. There he saw Kai Yang holding his broom and grinning while walking towards them.

Everybody’s faces fell.

“Good morning my fellow brother and sister disciples. You are all such diligent people, practising so early in the morning.” Kai Yang greeted everyone, while purposely looking over at Zhou Hu and Li Yun Tian, who both backed away, their faces red. When they thought about the power of Kai Yang’s fists, their skin crawled.

“Why did you come here?” Su Mu was a bit worried. Although he already knew Kai Yang’s motive, he still asked. After all, he had opened his mouth and assured everyone yesterday that he would deal with Kai Yang.

“To challenge.” His smile incomparably wide, Kai Yang’s gaze swept throughout the throng of people. Cordially he asked: “Which fellow disciples haven’t been challenged in these past few days? Please allow this senior to test your might.”

The Sky Tower’s Main Gate rules state that you should not avoid challenges and not shy away from them! Disobey, and you will be expelled.

With these rules in place, the people under Su Mu were deathly afraid of Kai Yang. For as long as the opponent issued a challenge, they would have to accept if they had not been challenged in these past five days. That would mean, even if they knew they would receive a beating, they could only brace themselves and accept.

That day, Zhang San was the one who was challenged. Satisfied, Kai Yang walked away, while Su Mu damned him and hurled curses at his back.

The next day, Kai Yang came again, that time it was Li Shi who got challenged. Walking away satisfied after winning once again, Su Mu threatened Kai Yang non-stop but it was to no avail.

On the third day, Kai Yang had come yet again, it was Wang Wu who got unlucky and received a swollen face and bloody nose for his troubles. Once again, his heart satisfied, Kai Yang left, while Su Mu swore weakly.

When Kai Yang had came the fourth time, Su Mu had also learned. Su Mu no longer threatened or cursed Kai Yang, for he knew they were no use because this Senior Kai was not afraid of his threats at all.

Su Mu only fiercely glared at him, harbouring a bone and soul piercing hatred.

Enduring this type of frustrating torment, the people under Su Mu had begun to quit.

This was plain bullying by Kai Yang. For there were many ordinary disciples throughout Sky Tower, yet he purposely came to challenge the disciples under Su Mu. It was very clear that he was here for revenge. Not to mention, the amount of people within this group was not small; so he would always be able to find someone to challenge and obtain favourable results.

Within these past few days, Kai Yang had caused quite a tempest. He was only a lowly trial disciple, yet he really was a salty fish that turned over and he managed to make everyone pay attention to him. Ever since he had defeated Zhou Hu, he had changed into someone that others weren’t able to easily beat or manipulate. Everyday he would go and challenge disciples and each time he would win. Rumors even stated that Su Mu had gotten to the point that he no longer retaliated. What type of person was Su Mu ah, he was someone with powerful backing.

Even someone like him couldn’t do anything to Kai Yang, so what could ordinary disciples do? Subsequently, no disciples dared to go and challenge Kai Yang. Not one person was unaware that this person who had entered for three years and had been demoted to a trial disciple was not an easily provoked person.

As this news travelled through the many disciples, many were guessing at his cultivation. Some guessed that he was at the tempered body fourth stage, some said tempered body fifth stage and some even guessed tempered body eighth stage. After all he did defeat the tempered body seventh stage practitioner Li Yun Tian.

But no matter who, no one knew Kai Yang’s true cultivation.

Only Xia Ning Chang knew! These past few days, every time Kai Yang went to challenge someone, she was always there peeking. With her natural talent and cultivation, she could naturally see Kai Yang’s true level.

But since Xia Ning Chang could see his true cultivation, she feared him.

This junior, when he had defeated Li Yun Tian, he was only at that tempered body fifth stage. And with the passing of a mere four days, he had risen to the tempered body sixth stage.

How did he cultivate? Even if it was her, armed with her special physique, when she was cultivating in the tempered body stage, she had used no small amount of medicinal pellets, yet she wasn’t as fast as him.

In a state of confusion, Xia Ning Chang had sneakily stalked Kai Yang to investigate how he cultivated. Though, no matter where she looked, or went, she couldn’t unravel the mystery or find anything unusual. He only punched a few fists, kicked his feet and made himself all weary and sweaty.

Xia Ning Chang couldn’t understand how the basic techniques of Sky Tower could make him so powerful. They weren’t even profound techniques.

At the end of her investigation spanning these past few days, Xia Ning Chang was left clueless. Although she had a feeling that Kai Yang still had hidden secrets, she was not bold enough to continue investigating. For a young girl to often peek at someone was not an honorable act, especially a youngster who was often half naked.

Everytime Xia Ning Chang looked, she became beet red and ashamed endlessly. Everytime this person trained, he would take off his shirt, as if his bony ribs were something good to show off.

“However, he seemed to be more robust than before, with more muscles.” Thinking back to the time she first saw his **, Xia Ning Chang unconsciously compared. When she finished comparing, her faced flushed red again.

Meanwhile Kai Yang was oblivious to the fact that he had been watched these past days. Everyday he would sweep his assigned area and then go find Su Mu’s group to challenge them. Afterwards, he would return back home to start his training. This was repetitive and tedious work, but also very fulfilling.

The incense burner’s impact was exceptionally large, and matched with the daily tempered body record training, it had allowed him to break through to the tempered body sixth stage yesterday. This made the atmospheric energy within his body further solidify and stabilize.

With another step, with just another step he would step into the tempered body seventh stage. Once he reached this stage, he would be able to produce his own vitality; even though the amount he would be able to produce wasn’t that much, it was still vitality. Also as long as he could produce his own vitality, he could then start to cultivate martial skills. At that time, his attacks would not longer be restricted to the leg whip and the shaolin fists.

The tempered body seventh to ninth stages were the stage in which one’s’ vitality developed, and also when the vitality travelled through a practitioner’s meridians and allowed them to reach the mastery stage. Only in this stage when one’s vitality was being born could this be achieved, you must then use it to break open the heaven and earth bridge so as to break away from the tempered body boundary to the next stage.

It was like playing with your own life, this training of Kai Yang’s, each and everyday Kai Yang could feel his growth; it was an extremely vivid feeling. Today, Kai Yang was finally able to practise his fists while under the influence the incense perfume, but the duration he was able to endure wasn’t very long. When he practised the tempered body piece in the mornings, it had become easier, and was improving everyday.

If these conditions were maintained, Kai Yang was confident that he could truly mature and become stronger.

But Kai Yang was in an embarrassing situation, his Dead Jedi Tree Grass stock had run out and his Three Leaved Chaos Spirit Flower, although sparingly used, was almost finished as well.

These past few days, Kai Yang had used the herbs sparingly, but he still ran out. As he used them, they had inevitably run out.

With no alternative, Kai Yang could only go to the Contribution Hall and use up all his remaining contribution points to purchase these herbs.

Chapter 31 - Tonight, raid Kai Yang during the night

Sponsored by - Pang V.

This time, out of the goodness in his heart, Treasurer Meng gave Kai Yang a few extra clippings of the herbs, but he still refused to let go of the matters pertaining to his cultivation. He constantly asked how Kai Yang manage to improve his strength so quickly.

It looked like the news of Kai Yang beating Su Mu’s underlings had even reached Treasurer Meng’s ears.

Towards Treasurer Meng, Kai Yang still had a reasonably good impression. Although the old man was a bit crazy and thick skinned, he was very likable when measured by Kai Yang’s standards.

This situation wasn’t easily explained, so Kai Yang could only say that when he was in Black Wind Mountains, he ate a special fruit which allowed him to gain enlightenment on how to cultivate.

After contemplating for a while, Treasurer Meng thought back to the time period when Kai Yang entered the mountains and his current behaviour. This explanation was the most reasonable and believable explanation, so Treasurer had no choice but to accept it.

Exiting the Contribution Hall, Kai Yang was deeply worried.

All of his contribution points had been used to purchase these herbs and by his estimation, they would only last him three to four days. Afterwards, what would he use to get these herbs?

Even though he was able to earn two contribution points from his daily challenges, these points could only be accessed on the eighth day of every month. With his calculations, he would need to wait twenty days. How could he possibly wait until then?

Without being able to think of a solutions, Kai Yang became depressed and could only continue training.

A few days passed by in a blur, and Kai Yang’s tempered body sixth stage cultivation began to stabilize and he marched towards the seventh stage.

In comparison to Kai Yang’s good mood, Su Mu’s followers felt like they were thrown into a flaming abyss. These past few days, Kai Yang would come to find them and cause trouble, causing them to feel vexed beyond compare. They couldn’t contend against him in strength and couldn’t hide from him, it was stifling beyond compare.

While Su Mu personally held some confidence at his chance of victory should he fight Kai Yang, unfortunately for the others the gap between them and Kai Yang was too large. They couldn’t challenge him -- Su Mu still thought that Kai Yang was at the tempered body fourth or fifth stage.

Su Mu knew that this could continue no longer, if it continued any longer, then all his underlings would leave.

Thinking for awhile, Su Mu prepared to do something heartless and called all the Sky Tower disciples who had been beaten by Kai Yang, frowning he said: “Tonight, raid Kai Yang’s hut during the night, wipe away all shame you have suffered!”

Since they couldn’t win by following the rules, they won’t follow them at all!

Everyone jumped up, startled: “A raid?”

“En.” Su Mu nodded his head.

“This isn’t good.” Li Yun Tian was hesitant: “Although that guy Kai Yang is a bit dishonest, he at least openly challenged and defeated us all. If the news of us mounting a sneak attack got out, we would be unable to escape punishment.”

Li Yun Tian’s statements got the agreement of all the people present.

Su Mu indignantly replied: “But he is too much! He has completely disregarded us fellow disciples and comes everyday. If we don’t give him a proper lesson, who knows how long this ferocious act will continue. Regardless, tonight I will definitely go cause some trouble for him. All those willing to do so, follow me, as for those who are unwilling I won’t force you. If anything were to happen, I swear that I, Su Mu will bear all consequences and won’t involve you.”

Su Mu’s words were sincere, and even if they still felt that it wasn’t honorable, they couldn’t refute his position. After all, Su Mu had promised to carry all the consequences on his shoulders, showing the utmost benevolence.

Thinking for a bit, Li Yun Tian spoke: “This is also good. If this succeeds, then we will be able to teach that bastard that we aren’t so easily provoked. Young master Su, this time, this disciple will put his life on the line and play with you!”

“We will also come.” The remaining people chorused.

Nodding and smiling, Su Mu cried: “That’s right!”

That night, with everybody’s spirit trembling in excitement they gathered in Su Mu’s room waiting until sunset.

“Is everybody ready?” Su Mu inquired.

They nodded their heads.

“Good. This time we must make this moment unforgettable for that bastard!” Su Mu shouted, while putting a black cloth over his face, leaving only a slim gap from which his evil gaze leaked out. Their emotions roused, the others followed suite.

“Set off!” Calling for action, Su Mu issued the move out order.

Ten or so shadows flashed out of his room, quickly merging into the night’s darkness.

During the night, Sky Tower had disciples posted about patrolling the premises. Unfortunately, Su Mu and his group were Sky Tower disciples too and were all too familiar with the patrol routes, allowing them to easily avoid these patrols.

Otherwise, why would a family thief be hard to ward against. Su Mu’s current actions were a model example of this saying.

Shortly, Su Mu’s group gathered in front of Kai Yang’s small wooden hut. Standing about ten to twenty feet away, they suppressed the sounds of their breathing, their indignation flared at the memory of the injustice they had suffered.

“There are no lights inside the hut, Kai Yang must be asleep already.” Calming his heart, Su Mu turned his head to face Li Yun Tian at his side: “Kai Yang’s strength isn’t weak. So later you and I will hold him down, while everyone else beats him, remember to use all your strength.”

“Okay.” Li Yun Tian nodded his head.

“As long as it’s not life threatening, you can hit however you want.” Su Mu reminded, and they all promised.

“Go!” Waving his hand, Su Mu shot towards the wooden hut. Ten shadows flickered against the night, rushing onwards. Those who cultivated, could run without making the slightest noise, they just needed to suppress the noise of their breathing to hide their presence. Their imaginations running wild, all their spirits rose as they thought about how Kai Yang would look injured and bloody.

This past few days, they were tormented miserably by Kai Yang.

Even though they were still around ten feet away, the cold gleam in Su Mu’s eyes became more intense and his lips couldn’t help but curve upwards.

As the distance shrunk, the wooden hut’s wooden door could be seen, in the blink of an eye Su Mu had already started to reach out to push open the door.

Suddenly, a sweet fragrance entered his nose. Smelling this fragrance, Su Mu felt that this fragrance was very strange. It didn’t smell very nice, nor did it smell very bad, it truly was a fragrance that he had never smelt before.

Although he was a bit suspicious, Su Mu didn’t give it any more thought and continued to charge forwards.

Stepping forward, Su Mu’s body became soft, he narrowly avoided falling. Breaking out in cold sweat, Su Mu recalled just moments ago it felt like all his strength had been sucked out from him. His brain buzzing he became mind became muddled, tiredly he steadied himself.

Taking another step caused Su Mu to directly fall to the ground, nose first. Then two warm streams flowed down from his nose filling his mouth with the metallic taste of blood.

“Pa, pa, pa........” A series of sounds sounded out and converged towards the wooden hut originating from the Sky Tower disciples that had followed Su Mu. One by one, each of them, like Su Mu, fell to the ground. Each of them felt weak and powerless, all had bloody noses and battered looks. Their anguished wailing resounded out in the quiet night, making it all the more livelier.

“What’s the matter?” Struggling greatly, Su Mu turned his head towards Li Yun Tian and asked.

Li Yun Tian struggled to drag himself back upright, but he was powerless and could only lay on the ground gasping for breath. This expression was horrendously ugly, hesitatingly he said: “Young master Su, I’m afraid that we have been poisoned.”

“Poisoned?” Su Mu turned pale in fright.

“In addition, it’s a very powerful poison.....” Trembling, Li Yun Tian reached out with his hand: “Young......master Su, I’m afraid that I can’t hold on any longer. You.....you must get revenge for me!”

After he finished passing on his last will and testament, Li Yun Tian’s head fell and he ceased all movement.

Overwhelmed by shock, Su Mu desperately and repeatedly called out his name. But no matter how many times he called out, he couldn’t wake him. When he turned his head around again, he saw that of the brother disciples that he had brought with him, none had escaped. All without exception were laying still, making no sound.

(TL: You would think that Kai Young would have sensed or at least heard all this noise by now. Wot?ლ(ಠ_ಠლ) ED: Honey badger don’t give a f***.)

An indescribable sense of panic and mourning filled his heart, unexpectedly, Su Mu’s was able to calm his mind in this situation.

This was the territory of Sky Tower, how could they be poisoned? And this poison’s effect was this potent, not even three breaths had passed before their lives were taken, one by one.

WOOAAHHH! This is fresh, first time MC99
